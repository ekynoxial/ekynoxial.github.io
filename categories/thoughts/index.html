        <p>The triathlon race season will start again soon here in the UK, and with the plethora of winter running races and other duathlons available — not to mention overseas racing — I can see a lot of my friends and twitter buddies getting in some fast action over the week-ends.</p>




<p>However, I noticed a trend lately: this also comes with plenty of them doubting themselves for the goals they have set a long way back. For most, they&rsquo;ve been reasonable in setting those up, so it&rsquo;s all about confidence and re-adjustment.</p>

        <p>About 11 months ago I started my first personal coached plan with Jo Carritt through the training business she runs with her partner Steven Lord: Every Day Training. 10 months of discovery of what such a plan entails, of performance improvements, and ultimately discovery of myself.</p>

    </header>

    
        <p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see the news about doping in sports, Lance Armstrong going down and others around him. Interesting also to see how many people are/were looking up to him, and more generally in sports, to the elite competitors. Be it football, cycling, swimming or any other sport that has a profesional elite representation, you&rsquo;ll sure find someone that will aspire to be them, to whom these elite few will be heroes and models.</p>




<p>Some of them are true heroes and have sacrificed a lot to get to the top of their sport. But more often than not, I feel this is the case in sports that are not largely publicised, and do not benefit from consequent investments that main stream sports have. Some profesional sports are riddled with overpaid elements that do nothing else than complain while still getting large pay cheques. Take football as an example: there is way too much money in and around it, and that plagues the sport. You&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find a town in the UK where no one likes football, but I feel this &lsquo;adoption&rsquo; is fabricated, and a giant marketing farce. If you really think about it, why would you be in awe of players who make millions every year, yet don&rsquo;t seem to show much respect for each other on the pitch. That&rsquo;s not a great models for kids is it?</p>




<p>On the other hand, you&rsquo;ve got athletes in sports which aren&rsquo;t in the media often, and are only publicised when big events like the Olympics happen. Athletics, swimming, show jumping, triathlon, you name it! Who knows how hard they train and what they sacrifice for these races, for hitting their own dream of getting to the top of their sport, regardless of funding and publicity?</p>




<p>I do triathlon, and although it has recently benefited from a bit more exposure in the UK thanks to the amazing achievements of the GB team at the olympics, it is still not a majorly publicised sport. Yet it draws attention from plenty of people, new comers from all sorts of background, and is doing all it can to be all-inclusive. The great thing about it is that you mostly get to race on the same courses, on the same day, and, in some races, at the same time than the pros! Race Organisers are making a point, even in large events like the London triathlon, to allow everyone who&rsquo;s up for a challenge and can swim far enough, to compete amongst all others. I&rsquo;ve seen people swim breaststroke, ride the bike course on a fully equipped dutch bike ringing their bell around the course, and walk the 5Km of a sprint &ldquo;race&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s about participating, completing their challenge.</p>




<p>Being involved with the <a title="ESC D3 Triathletes" href="http://d3triathlon.com">ESC D3 Triathletes</a> club and having done my level 1 triathlon coaching qualification, I can vouch for what I consider the real heroes of the sport, and more generally, the real heroes of any sport, seeing it first hand. They are those who set themselves a goal, and then go and do it, no matter what. They are the ones who take an event as their ultimate achievement, and don&rsquo;t care how much effort they put into it, because that&rsquo;s what they said they&rsquo;d do. Real heroes don&rsquo;t roll on the ground 5 times because someone brushed passed them running after a ball. They stand up, and keep going, and they finish what they set out to do.</p>




<p>So next time your neighbour is telling you they&rsquo;re targeting a 5Km run or a charity bike ride as their event, give them a sign of appreciation, and if you can, help them on their journey. They&rsquo;ve set out to do it not because it&rsquo;s easy for them, but because it&rsquo;s hard. And they WILL do it! No matter what.  They should be your heroes too.</p>

        <h1><a href="/clarifications-on-the-richmond-magazine" title="Clarifications on the Richmond magazine...">Clarifications on the Richmond magazine...</a></h1>
    </header>

    
        <p>This morning I relayed a message from freespeedlondon twitter account on my own timeline, on <a href="/the-only-good-cyclist-is-a-dead-one-editor-of-the-richmond-magazine-september-issue/" title="“… the only good cyclist is a dead one …” – Editor of the Richmond Magazine – September issue">this blog</a> and on a <a title="road.cc" href="http://road.cc/content/forum/65843-%E2%80%A6-only-good-cyclist-dead-one-%E2%80%A6%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-editor-richmond-magazine-%E2%80%93-september-issue">road.cc forum post</a>. Richard Nye, editor at Sheen Gate for the Richmond Magazine wrote a truly appalling column in the September edition, but I wasn&rsquo;t quite expecting to see the acerb comments and vilification of my forum post being made.</p>




<p class="attachement"><a href="http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2012-09-06-clarifications-on-the-richmond-magazine/Screen-Shot-2012-09-06-at-16.29.25.png" title="" rel="lightbox[1360]"><img src="http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2012-09-06-clarifications-on-the-richmond-magazine/Screen-Shot-2012-09-06-at-16.29.25_r300.png" alt="" /></a></p>




<p>Let&rsquo;s be very clear here: I&rsquo;m not one to claim the man to resign, be sacked or web-lynched, and I have not. Some comments on this story have, and honestly, I disagree. But this information has to be known. To do so, and in the event that the issue gets pulled out or edited of their website, I have, like freespeed and the Richmond Cycling Campaign, saved it so it can still be accessed later on.</p>




<p>We&rsquo;re pretty much all road users at some point: cyclists, motorists, pedestrians etc&hellip; or any combination of those. I&rsquo;ll happily agree that on both sides there are a minority who don&rsquo;t abide by the rules, don&rsquo;t know them or simply don&rsquo;t care, but by no means they are majority.</p>




<p>The kind of comments made by Richard Nye are just not acceptable. No matter how you want to read the context of the editorial, you cannot retract the words (exactly as they have been printed) &ldquo;as a daily driver on busy roads, I tend towards the temperate view that the only good cyclist is a dead one&rdquo;. In or out of context, I cannot see how his response on twitter later on can have any value, claiming to be &ldquo;misunderstood&rdquo;. The words are there, he has written them. I&rsquo;m a daily cyclist, and I try as much as I can to abide by the rules. I&rsquo;m not perfect either, but I&rsquo;d like to be safe. And if you don&rsquo;t even bat an eyelid at this kind of comment (even when made in the editorial of a 40000 copies publication), my guess is that your probably not in the category of road users who would like to share the road peacefully.</p>




<p>road.cc user tony_farelly has <a title="road.cc comments" href="http://road.cc/content/forum/65843-%E2%80%A6-only-good-cyclist-dead-one-%E2%80%A6%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-editor-richmond-magazine-%E2%80%93-september-issue#comment-119385">rightly pointed out</a> the other distressing cycling news this week, but I also need to tell him the one he didn&rsquo;t mention: The death of a 79 year old in Walton on Thames, neighbouring borough to Richmond, yesterday 5th September (<a title="Walton on Thames 79 year old cyclist" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-19491400">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-19491400</a>). Maybe that&rsquo;s something worth spend a bit of time and bile on? I doubt anyone would joke about that.</p>




<p>Maybe, only maybe, the column intended to be humorous, but you&rsquo;ve got to weigh your words for your audience, and this one wasn&rsquo;t funny at all. In the most cycle friendly borough in London, with the best place to leisure cycle and train in the capital with Richmond Park in its centre, I think it&rsquo;s fair enough to publicise it. It is after all our own right of free press too.</p>
