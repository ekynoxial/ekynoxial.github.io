            <p>Today&rsquo;s feature on <a href="http://www.everydaytraining.org.uk/" title="EDT Camp day four">EDT</a> Camp was the Tabayesco time trial. With about 500m of ascent over 10Km, that was the first of the three handicapped races, where riders were set off in an order determined from the previous timed events.
After winning the TT on the first day, needless to say that expectations were high, and not just from myself! Thanks to everyone in the group for that! I had a target to beat!</p>

<p>Prior to this, the morning swim saw us do a nice bay-to-beach-and-back swim. That was a welcome change from the standard loops, with a few more things to see underwater as well! I had the camera with me, so that should make it through the camp film later on.</p>

<p>After raiding the buffet breakfast once more, we rode 40 km in a strong headwind to get to the bottom of the climb, where riders were then set-off at 30s or 1min intervals. From two synchronised watches, the times were expertly taken at the top by <a href="https://twitter.com/SportsMassageSB">Sarah</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/millsphysio">Ali</a>, handicapped results being worked-out later-on by Steven at the Mirador de Haria cafe.</p>

<p>As I did a good time on the El Golfo TT on Sunday, I was the last one to start before Steven, and the expectation put on me by pretty much everyone was that I&rsquo;d catch most of them&hellip; Easier said than done!</p>

<p>With the wind blowing down the valley, and having lead legs from having started last, it was tough at first. But the heavy legs soon went away and I could just put my head down and concentrate on keeping the power up with a good leg turnover.</p>

<p>I wanted to try and not get caught by Steven, who was the course record holder, so I really pushed hard at the start, averaging close to 290-300W for several minutes, then had to slow down a bit to not completely explode. With my best ever turbo 20min effort being 289W, and a climb that should take around 30min to get over at speed, it was the right thing to do!
I stayed on the tri bars most of the way as this is how I train on the turbo, but had to sit-up in a few passages where I couldn&rsquo;t push the pedals hard enough in that position.
I reached the left turn, before the switchbacks, in around 18:30, so it was game-on to get under 30min at the top if I could maintain the effort. Having the others of the group ahead of me was a fantastic help though, as I had targets to chase all the time. It must be a lot harder to start at the front and keep motivated all the way.
With two corners to go after the windy switchbacks, I threw everything I had left and I couldn&rsquo;t believe that my watch was showing 28'59" when I crossed the line.</p>

<p>That was properly gut busting and everyone was feeling it well at the top, but there wasn&rsquo;t really any time to rest, as half of the group went for a hilly trail run around the observatory. I had never seen that side, and it&rsquo;s simply gorgeous!</p>

<p>Results of TT where announced when everyone was back at the cafe and eaten their bodyweight in cake, ice cream and cheese. I had won it on pure time, setting a new course record, but Ellen had also done just above 41min!! The initial goal for here being around 50min, that was a fantastic time! Get in missy! What a way to get up the &ldquo;hill&rdquo;!</p>

<div class="attachement iframe_wrapper"><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/89182544?portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


<p>Combined with her initial El-Golfo TT, it also meant she pipped everyone to the handicapped win by a mile! Unfortunately the conditions of the camp competitions are such that she couldn&rsquo;t claim the prize, but well done for winning it! That must boost your confidence big time!</p>

<p>But the prize of a <a href="http://www.freespeed.co.uk/">Freespeed bike fit</a> stayed &ldquo;in the family&rdquo; as Steven put it, as I was the second camper behind Ellen on handicap, which was pretty handy!</p>

<p>There have been a few surprises on this climb, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure everyone enjoyed it, even if it is secretly. We&rsquo;re nutters enough to do 6 days of overload in one of the most unfriendly bike environments, so I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re all enjoying those little races!</p>

<p>If you wonder how to run races for small groups and make them fun while giving everyone a chance: use handicaps! That&rsquo;s a fantastic way to keep everyone involved and guessing for results, as the fastest doesn&rsquo;t always win! There are numerous ways to do it and I need to grill Steven about his methods, but it&rsquo;s always entertaining.</p>

<p>After this, I took the long way back to the hotel with a few others, riding through Fire Mountain the other way: downhill! Views are again exceptional over there, and since we had already gone up the other side 3 times this week, it was only fair to get to do it this way at least once.</p>

<p>With the runs to and from swimming, the run at the top of the climb validated my run quota for today, so I could put my feet up a little tonight, which was most welcome!</p>
