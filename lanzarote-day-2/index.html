            <p>This is officially my first ever open water swim this year. With the wonderful weather we&rsquo;ve had in the UK so far, I&rsquo;ve only ever used my wetsuit a couple of times in the pool this year, and I feel it. It&rsquo;s rubbing everywhere, my neck is catching the flap at the back, and it feels too tight now that I&rsquo;ve got a bit more shoulders. But it will do as it&rsquo;s very thin and flexible. I still love that suit!</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The sea is calm, there&rsquo;s a bit of wind, but it&rsquo;s still quiet this morning. That should be a fairly easy swim, directions wise. Unlike my first iron distance in Spain, where it was one long 3.8K lap, it&rsquo;s a two lap affair here, so it will be a bit more entertaining as well with a loop on the beach pushed by the spectators around.
The plan this morning is to swim one lap of the course, with the second half at race pace. I&rsquo;m a better swimmer after <a title="Joanna Carritt" href="www.joannacarritt.co.uk">Jo Carritt</a>&rsquo;s training programme through the winter, but I&rsquo;m still fairly crap at pacing. I stop a few times and slow down along the outer leg of the swim, looking at the bottom of the ocean and the little fish swimming around me. There are a few rocks underneath, and lots of life around them. Why does one always have to wonder about sharks in these moments? There are other dark creatures around me, but more of the neoprene species. One makes an effort to pass me after the half way mark, but I manage stay on his feet for the &lsquo;race pace effort second half&rsquo; all the way back to the swim start, all feeling quite good and not over-exerting. Running out the water and diving back in to simulate the race itself I probably create a bit of entertainment for some other swimmers around: what a crap dive! SPLASH! I&rsquo;ll practice this a few times more to avoid winding myself out! I stop the watch. 34min. That was fast! It felt good, though, so it&rsquo;s giving me a bit more confidence for Saturday.
Walking back to the hotel in my wetsuit, I feel the warmth of the sun out here. At last! It&rsquo;s still 12C at home, it&rsquo;s 9C at my parents place and my dad just informs me my mum had to re-start the central heating&hellip; What a year!</p>

<p>After a more consequent breakfast, dad takes the wheel to get around the bike course. We didn&rsquo;t initially plan to drive it all, but it felt natural and easy. A bit like a road trip around the island. We completely missed the start of the route, but that&rsquo;s ok, I&rsquo;m more interested in checking out what I think are the harder parts. The little loop around El Golfo seems alright, with some winding and undulating roads with cross winds, but all in all not too bad. The road surface here is nice.</p>

<p>The Lunar sceneries of the National Park of Timanfaya add to the magic of the place. Possibly pictured on lots of photos from this race, it&rsquo;s going to be dead straight, in a head wind all the way to Tinajo and La Santa. Breath-taking lava rock everywhere and no room for error. Actually, no room for error anywhere, really. It echoes what I read from this race and from Hawaii: razor sharp lava rock awaits if you get off the road. Just don&rsquo;t! This is the moon, and it would hurt!</p>

<p>The Tinajo - La Santa - Famara - Teguise - Haria road is something I know, having done it the other way around for the 70.3 in November. Except that from Famara, all the way to the top will be 25Km of climbing pretty much non stop. And it doesn&rsquo;t stop at Haria. After a bit of respite at the aid staition and a nice winding decent, it soon climbs again all the way to Mirador del Rio. The views there are crazy. No one in its right mind would think to ever take a TT bike up there. No one. It&rsquo;s mental. There&rsquo;s a 500m cliff on the left, cross winds battling the top, and a 2m wide road with little lava rock walls either side. We stop up there for a few pictures, and all my dad and his 40 years of cycling experience can say is &ldquo;Well, son&hellip; Good luck!&rdquo; in a slow mo, deep voice you&rsquo;d only find in an old western movie. Thanks dad to add to the dramatic sceneries around! I know it won&rsquo;t be easy, but that&rsquo;s exactly why I&rsquo;m here! So hearing my dad say that is possibly one of the nicest things to help me to do well.</p>

<p>The road back is at first winding down towards the coast, then long and boring, from Arieta through Teguise and back towards the finish. Mental toughness will be required here as even if it &ldquo;should&rdquo; be tailwind, it&rsquo;s going to be require some concentration on some nasty roads and the last fast 8Km downhill to the line.
Overall, the course feels tough. But it&rsquo;s also full of variety and a very far cry from my first iron in Barcelona where it was all straight, straight, straight, and all flat.</p>

<p>I then go for a small run late in the afternoon as well to check the course. It&rsquo;s fairly warm at 24C, but not stupidly hot. I meet quite a few athletes on route as well. They all say hi. That&rsquo;s what I like about this sport: no matter why you&rsquo;re here, pro or amateur, qualifier or finisher, no matter your motives, we&rsquo;re all in the same boat.
The run course is winding along the sea at first, some places will be a bit narrow, but it soon opens up and the pavement gets large enough. I run almost all the way to the turnaround of the short lap, following my run/walk strategy. I probably won&rsquo;t run at the same pace on race day, but right now I feel comfortable and well in control. My run has also improved so much over the last 6 months, even with an injury and no practice for almost 1.5 month after the half Wokingham half back in February. With the power meter on the bike, I&rsquo;ll hopefully still have some legs at this point in the race!</p>

<p>One can dream!</p>
