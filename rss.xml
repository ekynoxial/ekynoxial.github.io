                <title>Ironman 70.3 Mallorca</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I registered last year to be part of the Black Line London &amp;ldquo;special place in the sun&amp;rdquo; - its birthplace on the island of Mallorca - and have a nice warm race before concentrating on the final preparations for Ironman UK in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2015-05-09-ironman-70-dot-3-mallorca/bike5.JPG&quot; title=&quot;Bike 5&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[mallorca_70.3_2015]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2015-05-09-ironman-70-dot-3-mallorca/bike5_r500.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Bike 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Having raced the &lt;a href=&quot;/triathlon-internacional-portocolom-111-2015/&quot;&gt;Portocolom 111 triathlon&lt;/a&gt; 4 weeks ago, with a very good result, I was expecting to do reasonably well for the 70.3, but being realistic that this race is usually pretty fast, and with a massive field. Realistically, the top spots were out of reach (with top 10 in 30-34 last year all being faster than 4h30') but recent swim tests and a reasonable progression through the winter in the other two disciplines also indicated that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do too badly, if I could muster the hot run with little heat adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to transition for 6:30 am wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad, and the usual butterflies made me smile. That&amp;rsquo;s race morning for me: a bit of apprehension, a lot of excitement and the general calm before the storm.
After the usual bike final prep with shoes, nutrition and wishing a great race to the few I saw in the biggest transition zone on earth, I headed to the beach for a bit of a warmup, then watch the pros and ladies get on their way before joining the start pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself very close to the front of my wave, right on the left, on the second row. That&amp;rsquo;s now more by habit than a very conscious decision, but it&amp;rsquo;s the best thing to do for me. Still being an &amp;ldquo;average&amp;rdquo; swimmer (relative to my overall results), the first 200m sprint was painful to get into my stroke, but to my surprise, I got clear water pretty much from the start. Waves starts, and dividing some AGs in halves, probably helped. A few taps on the toes here and there, and a few athletes swimming into me (or the other way around!) were really the biggest troubles I had through a swim that I was expecting to be a lot harder.
I rounded the buoys feeling strong, swimming straight, and catching up people from the previous waves. The way back to shore was completed pretty much alone, except for one crazy fast swimmer on whose feet I tried to jump on. But the speed difference was so great that in two strokes, he was gone&amp;hellip; I still have some work to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very shallow water made the exit fun with a bit of dolphin diving.
30'59&quot; at my watch over the timing mat. Feck. Really! I had swum twice at almost 30' dead in the pool over the two previous weeks, so I was hoping to go sub 30 in salty water with a wetsuit&amp;hellip; I still have to convert pool speed to OWS speed, but I&amp;rsquo;ll take that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my way to T1, I got massive cheers from Guillem&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend (a local friend) and other supporters recognising the Black Line London kit which was great to push through the long transition.
Long in distance, but well managed. It&amp;rsquo;s impressive to realise how far I&amp;rsquo;ve come from the first races I did back in 2008, where I had a crazy amount of stuff in my T1 bag&amp;hellip; Now: glasses, helmet, run to get the bike, done!
I was blocked a little bit by some slow-pokes skating around on their shoes cleats, but nothing major and I was soon in my element, starting my come-back towards the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flat way to Pollenca was fast and furious, and all I could think off was to pass as many people as I could before the climb and subsequent descent, to not get blocked there. The very calm conditions in the morning helped the pace and quite quickly, there were very few red bibs left to be seen (faster swimmers in my wave). In fact I had made up almost 40 places in the first 15.5K where the climbing really started!
I pushed on over the climb, and felt really good - albeit a little hot in the speed suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/supergal007&quot;&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; &amp;frac34; of the way into the climb just as her gears were playing up, and told her to relax and get through it, which she seems to have done.
I kept passing people all the way up, and down before the last little bit of climbing to get to the petrol station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having recced the course last month with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_danielmoll&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; and gone over that descent several times, I knew exactly what to expect. A TT bike isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily the best handling machine for switchbacks, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t deter me from pushing hard on the descent, and flying past many less confident cyclists.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever shouted that much on a bike ride before: pretty much all the way from T1 to the top of the climb, I was telling riders to keep right. No prisoners taken, but it paid off and I had almost a clear road through the descent and the rest of the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although appearing mostly flat on the profile, the last 40K are actually not easy. First, there&amp;rsquo;s this nasty little climb and the bad roads before Campanet. I knew they were coming, but that little climb was harder than I remembered it!
Then, the long drags along the back roads were energy sapping, with the headwind that had now lifted, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel my best. Power numbers were down, so I think I may have overdone the climb a little bit ;-)
Still, a 2h32' bike split was better than I expected, so I&amp;rsquo;m quite pleased with it. However, given that I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel that great on the second half of the bike, the question was now: &amp;ldquo;Will I be able to run?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like at the Portocolom 111 triathlon last month, T2 was delayed by having to tape my bad toe, and the heat had melted the tape so much I could barely unroll it! I probably lost about a minute faffing around with it. Too bad, but it had to be done, and at least my HR got down before attacking what I was expecting to be an absolute struggle with the heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shooting of transition at sub 4min/Km I felt really good. Small steps, good cadence, and letting a couple of guys who passed me in T2 go on their way. I could (and I did) catch them later!
The pace was pretty fast for what I usually run, and at some point I even thought that I could get close to my straight half marathon PB. It didn&amp;rsquo;t happen as the pace gradually slowed down, but it was still well beyond my expectations.
Having eaten and drank properly on the bike, going through my 6 gels and one pack of chews, plus a couple bottles of water, I never felt hungry or uneasy on the run. I managed to grab a few cups of coke and water, plus a lot of sponges to cool down, and I have to say that this worked a treat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest lift was from milking the atmosphere. I caught &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/janehansom&quot;&gt;Jane&lt;/a&gt; pretty early on the run, which did surprise me, but she still went on to win her AG&amp;hellip; What an amazing athlete she is!
I also managed to high-five kids all the way around the first lap while it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too congested. It&amp;rsquo;s always fun, and something I like doing. Hopefully that bit of interaction will help them understand that it&amp;rsquo;s not all about beating the others, but also enjoying the day and having fun!
Then came the &amp;ldquo;Black Line&amp;rdquo; cheers. Racing in the custom kit is fantastic, as you get support all around the course. Some people, I recognised vaguely, some others I had no idea who they were. But hearing &amp;ldquo;go blackline&amp;rdquo; several times a lap certainly helped a lot. Thanks to you all!
Then, on each lap, right before the finish line, were Gary and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rogerbarr&quot;&gt;Roger&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many beers they had before my first passage, if any, but they certainly were shouting louder than anyone else! I felt a boost of energy every time I went through there there, and was very much looking forward to this part of the lap, which was conveniently placed right before the finish chute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last lap got really packed. Very cramped at aid stations and close to impossible to get water or coke. I resorted to only grab sponges and I kept pushing as there was only under 5K to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s strange, but I distinctly remember thinking &amp;ldquo;Is it really over already?&amp;rdquo;. Is that the sign of a great race? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but this one will certainly stay a long time in my memory as my best half ironman yet. Not my fastest one, but the best executed one. A 1h27'40&quot; run is about 3min faster than I have ever run on a half IM. And THAT makes me super happy, because I really count on my run to make the difference at IM UK in 10 weeks time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well done to everyone who raced in Mallorca. And specially to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sophie_biggs&quot;&gt;Sophie Biggs&lt;/a&gt; and Tanya Barr for their first triathlon and first 70.3 respectively. Well done to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alastairmaher&quot;&gt;Al Maher&lt;/a&gt; for finishing the race in a &amp;ldquo;really not shit&amp;rdquo; time, despite having been taken down by a fellow, out-of-control, competitor on a descent. Well done to the &amp;ldquo;Leister brothers&amp;rdquo; to achieving their goal while flying fluoro yellow cap-flaps around the run!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;never again&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;why on earth would anyone want to double the distance&amp;rdquo; thoughts have now subsided. It&amp;rsquo;s time to get back in training for the big one. 10 weeks before a proper, clearly stated, assault at qualifying for the big dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, keep smiling, keep inspiring me and be inspired. Keep cheering your athletes, and go support others if you can. Be part of a team of friends. It&amp;rsquo;s worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Triathlon Internacional Portocolom 111 2015</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Having never been to Mallorca, but knowing that it&amp;rsquo;s the spiritual birth place of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackline.london&quot; title=&quot;Blackline London&quot;&gt;Black Line London&lt;/a&gt;, I had in mind to go check it out at some point, and I had registered for the 70.3 later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But prior to this, in April, is held what use to be the Tristar race, now known again as the Portocolom triathlon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2015-04-12-triathlon-internacional-portocolom-111-2015/san-salvador.jpg&quot; title=&quot;san-salvador_r500.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[20150412-portocolom]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2015-04-12-triathlon-internacional-portocolom-111-2015/san-salvador_r500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;san-salvador_r500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_danielmoll&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; was going for a trip and racing, and having booked a large accommodation, he invited me to come along.
That was the perfect gig to test the legs early in the season, while spending the previous week enjoying a bit of warmer weather than in the UK!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That week was spent in a gorgeous little village called Campanet, very close to Caimari and the foothills of the climb to Lluc. Conveniently, this is part of the 2015 bike course for the 70.3, so going up and down Lluc from either side a few times during the week would prove invaluable for the 70.3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Protocolm race has been going on since 1998 under the Triathlon Protocolom name, before it became Tristar Mallorca in 2011, then back to its original name after 2013. Limited to 1000 participants, it is held on fully closed roads, with (if you do the 111) two ascents of the Sant Salvador climb. This has been by far the best race I&amp;rsquo;ve done outside the UK for it&amp;rsquo;s friendliness, relatively low key, easy, and relaxed attitude. Forget M-dot branding all over the place, this race is about making sure everyone has a blast, and with support like there was in town for the run and the small villages around the bike course, it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic race I&amp;rsquo;d recommend anyone who would want to kick start their season early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swim start is in deep water, but you first have to jump of the jetty. That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty high jump and I even managed to touch the bottom, before heading out to the &amp;ldquo;start&amp;rdquo;.
The relaxed attitude meant that everyone started to swim their race right after they jumped in, without a care in the world for the guys behind not being in the water yet. Cue quite a lot of hopeless shouting from the RD in a boat, a bit of confusion here and there, and eventually letting everyone go&amp;hellip;
I managed to bump into the RD&amp;rsquo;s boat as it had also drifted in everyone&amp;rsquo;s path, but the rest of the swim was pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I swam too bad at the time. 17min for 1K is what I can do in the pool so I was pleased for one of my first open water swims this year. I have no idea what my Garmin did, recording around 800m, but I was bang on the buoys and feeling good all the way.
The finish and exit was mayhem again as everyone ignored the last buoy and the left turn towards the pontoon, instead heading straight to shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T1 was probably quite long by any Olympic distance standard, having to run all the way around one bit of the marina, but pretty easy to navigate! I&amp;rsquo;m used to separate bags for T1 and T2, so having everything in the tiniest boxes you&amp;rsquo;ll find anywhere was a challenge for me. Other than that: nothing to report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bike I went straight to work. Having ridden the route with Dan a few days before, I knew where I could lift a bit, and the start was certainly not one of those places! You have to climb out of town first thing out of T1, so that keeps you heart rate up until the right turn going North East.
Then for a few twisty, snappy, bits before reaching one of the danger places of the course: a small village called San Marcià. In tehre, you are essentially going full speed, and have to take a deceivingly tight right-hander, with a few drain covers on the inside and gravel all around. I almost came off at this point, and I lifted heavily on the second lap to avoid it. Some other guys weren&amp;rsquo;t as lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;re over the north east part of the loop, you head back south-west towards THE climb. but before you reach it, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to deal with the very open wide roads, and the strong headwind that will sap your energy just enough to kill your legs right before they matter the most: the Sant Salvador monastery gradients. Categorised as a CAT2 climb, it&amp;rsquo;s not very long at around 5-6K counting the lower parts, but it&amp;rsquo;s a proper mountain in the middle of an otherwise relatively flat (okay, undulating&amp;hellip;) 50K TT loop. I settled into a nice rhythm on the way up, and managed to be on my way down before an ambulance clogged to road for people behind.
Sadly someone pushing hard at the front had an off at one of the hairpins and wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a great shape.
After the first ascent and descent, I had to lift a bit on the power as I was well over my 220W target (NP of 241 at this point, with a max 20min of 256W&amp;hellip; Whoops!).
As expected, having pushed hard on the first lap, the second one was a little slower, but on the second ascent, I counted that I was in 18th position and catching the front runners.
That gave me an amazing boost, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting at all to be that far up the rankings on a fast course!
The headwind was even stronger on the way back that second time, but the fully closed roads meant that I was riding completely on my own, on empty roads, and able to chose my line like the pros do on TTs. No one to get in the way, and no drafting idiots!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dismount line for T2 was way more forward than I expected, and I almost didn&amp;rsquo;t make it! That will teach me not to check everything before the race. My rear tire remembers it, having locked the wheel and skidded the end!
I lost a couple of places in transition due to having to tape my injured toe, but that was planned, and I was soon on my way for, I hoped, fast 10K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was April, but it was already very hot, and I was feeling like I was overheating in the speed suit. I got told off by an official on a bike for having it open, so I reluctantly closed it again, and kept dousing myself in water at every aid station.
The run course has a nasty sting in the tail at the far end. The little climb over there is steep indeed, but I kept going and kept to my ~4'/km pace.
I was passed only twice. The first guy was the eventual winner of the other race, the 55, that had started after us, and the second one was Andrew Woodroffe who&amp;rsquo;s an U23 ITU racer and more used to that distance. I could hear him coming, but I had nothing left to answer his move with 500m to go. The speed difference was big though, as he ran the equivalent of 36'46&quot; for a 10K. Had the run been the right distance (My Garmin said 10.44Km), maybe I&amp;rsquo;d have been able to dig and hold him off. I still ran under 40' for 10K, off a 235W NP 100K ride, so that&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was elated to finish 16th overall in a very early season race, which is a great setup for the next one, in just under a month, again in Mallorca, for the 70.3.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>No toe: no Mudman!</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Accident at home! I don&amp;rsquo;t even have a fun story of dropping a fridge or other heavy equipment on my toe. I just walked straight into a door frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not broken, but given how it looks, that means no running for a while, and that means no Mudman next week-end. :-(&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the conditions were absolutely perfect for a PB, the race this yer fell the day after the hard &lt;a href=&quot;/the-iceman-off-road-duathlon-2015/&quot; title=&quot;The iceman off-road duathlon&quot;&gt;Iceman off-road duathlon&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, racing it hard would have been futile and frankly stupid. HAving been ask by Carel to pace him for roughly a 1h45, I took the oportunity to stretch the legs on that crisp morning, chatting all the way.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The Iceman off-road duathlon 2015</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This year, there are only 3 races, and this is the second one. I remembered the hills&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2015-02-07-the-iceman-off-road-duathlon-2015/17_bike.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Iceman: Enjoying the mud&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[2015-06-12-Iceman]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2015-02-07-the-iceman-off-road-duathlon-2015/17_bike_r300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Iceman: Enjoying the mud&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Iceman: Enjoying the mud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I started &amp;ldquo;conservatively&amp;rdquo; (yes, that was conservative), because I remembered the hills from last year&amp;rsquo;s race. Sh*** they did hurt again! I did walk a fair bit of the hills intentionally, but worked hard on the descents, and that really paid off. I had ato manage a bit of a twinge behind my knees on the second lap, but it eventually cleared out so I could complete the first run without too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bike, I had an utterly rubbish start, as I had to stop straight out of T1 because of fogged up glasses. Then I remembered that I needed to take some air out of the tyres to have some grip in the mud&amp;hellip; Duhhh, stupid rookie mistakes. I&amp;rsquo;m in for the fun, but those kind of mistakes shouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen!
However, I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased that I rode over all hills, and powered through the rest of the laps. I overtook a lot of people, and almost had a massive off by managing to tangle my handlebars with another guy on a gravely descent (Scary shit!)
The supper deep mud ponds didn&amp;rsquo;t catch me either, and I managed not to fall anywhere (yay!).
I obviously have way too little MTB training, and my lack of skills clearly showed, especially at the start of the leg. But hey, this is good fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second run, I left out there everything I had left. By the time I started, I was completely alone, and with absolutely no one in sight ahead or behind! I managed to catch a few runners around the lap, including a couple on the last climb. Pretty fast second run, then, and a well executed race with a top 30 and 2nd in AG!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Goals. Milestones.</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I watched my girlfriend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/physiogirl&quot; title=&quot;Ellen Goldsmith on Twitter&quot;&gt;Ellen (@physiogirl)&lt;/a&gt; complete her first ever marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some, it may be a surprise, and it certainly was to me until recently, that she had never ran one before today.
But having set herself a beast of a goal for 2015, this was only a step in the journey she chose for herself, way back in spring.
In order to achieve her goal, she is ticking boxes in her preparation, and today was a milestone she needed to get over&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-12-28-goals-milestones/marathon_girl.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Marathon girl&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[20141228]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-12-28-goals-milestones/marathon_girl_r500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Marathon girl&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;!--more--&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back in March, she came along with me to the EDT endurance camp in Lanzarote, not as an accompanying member, but as a fully registered athlete. Just before leaving, however, she had been diagnosed with a stress fracture in her foot, and spent the whole camp (and a few more months after that), with her foot in an air cast, being generally miserable because she couldn&amp;rsquo;t do what she wanted to do. It was a stress fracture. One we know can heal and let athletes compete again at the highest level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many know Ellen not necessarily because of any particular results (That&amp;rsquo;s recently. She&amp;rsquo;s been a three day eventer at a very high level in her teens), but because of her sheer determination to not let anything or anyone stand in her way (including me). So a stress fracture, albeit extremely annoying at the time, wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to prevent her from roaming around, water run, swim, and cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;rsquo;s not because she has a will of iron that she manages to do everything she wants to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I telling you this? It&amp;rsquo;s simple: the training camp wasn&amp;rsquo;t for her. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;d argue that triathlon wasn&amp;rsquo;t for her. Those goals weren&amp;rsquo;t for her.
We met through sports, and the connecting link at the time was triathlon. She wanted to do more, and go longer, and I helped her improve her cycling and swimming. But what I failed to see was that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing what she&amp;rsquo;s best built for, and what she loves doing: run. And run far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t set those triathlon goals, but the expectation she put on herself wasn&amp;rsquo;t right. They were lofty goals, but inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That didn&amp;rsquo;t prevent her from trying very hard, and she pushed herself to the limit chasing them. She completed 70.3 Antwerp in just over 6h when she wanted to do 7. She pushed her body to a breaking point at 70.3 Zell-Am-See in the pouring rain and in very cold conditions to finish the race. For that, she got long lasting cold effects after the race, and was since told she&amp;rsquo;s got Reynauds syndrome, but all that mattered back then was that she did finish it.
However, she failed twice at getting around Lanzarote 70.3. Once for hypothermia. Once because of a knee problem. And that&amp;rsquo;s where we knew something wasn&amp;rsquo;t right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting goals and expectations is something she has to do carefully, and I am always weary to discuss them with her because we are both extremely competitive, and she was (until recently) still measuring herself to me. (No matter what she says!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my first piece of advice would be to set your goals appropriately. By all means: aim high. In fact, shoot for the stars! But do so in a discipline (or 3!), that you know you can do and enjoy doing. And unless you&amp;rsquo;re at the top of your sport, don&amp;rsquo;t measure yourself to others. It&amp;rsquo;s bad for you, and it&amp;rsquo;s bad for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ellen wasn&amp;rsquo;t enjoying much the wetsuit swimming with 1000 other people bashing her around at a race start&amp;hellip; Neither do you? No problem! There are other events to enter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know she loves running (especially early mornings to catch the sunrise), so it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that she&amp;rsquo;s now turning towards ultra running. That will suit her a lot more, and it will give her more piece of mind that she put herself into a place that she knows she&amp;rsquo;ll love. And I won&amp;rsquo;t follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Milestones&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you decide to run, there is kind of a natural progression: jog, run a 5K (park run), a 10K (local athletics race), a half-marathon (getting there!), or a marathon (Boston, New-York, Paris, London&amp;hellip; but not only). For many, the marathon is the running grail. Much like riding 200K on a bike or swimming 10K (maybe, I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; It seems long to me!) But there are longer, much longer events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, I know nothing about ultra running. For that, I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to go check the amazing journey of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.totkat.org/&quot; title=&quot;Kate Driskell - Tougher than anyone expected&quot;&gt;Kate Driskell&lt;/a&gt; and bombard her with questions. But there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I learnt along the years that helped me tremendously: know what I can do &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt;, and where I want to be &lt;strong&gt;next&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still remember huffing and puffing hard, barely completing without stopping a 5Krun around my workplace in 2007. That was the time I took on triathlon, as a friend roped me in. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t swim one length without needing a rest to recover. Talk about lofty goals! It seems that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the right goal, but having never really done any sports, I really enjoyed the journey and the diversity. I had set myself the goal to complete the London Olympic Triathlon the following year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my journey to get there, 10 months later, I got bored, and I got scared. At some point, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure why I was training, and if it was actually working. And the last thing I wanted to do was to arrive at the Docklands shit scared, having no idea how to do anything on &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; kind of scale. No amount of book or online forum reading would help anyone in that. So I set myself an intermediate target: a super-sprint triathlon at Eton-Dorney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That first race wasn&amp;rsquo;t about getting around as fast as I could. It was about reassuring myself that I could do it.
I had never swam in a wetsuit in open water, and had never swam with other people around me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what a brick session was, and I had absolutely no idea about nutrition. But I knew that I had to get on with this small step before I got to the &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I exited the water, I was one before last. But that didn&amp;rsquo;t matter, because at that time I knew that if I didn&amp;rsquo;t explode or crash on the bike, I&amp;rsquo;d finish. The swim was my problem and I had conquered it. I finished the race elated, and firmly setting my eye on the London triathlon, now knowing better what to train for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow me a little bit, you know that I didn&amp;rsquo;t stop there. But it&amp;rsquo;s this sort of little steps that make the bigger journey more manageable, more enjoyable, and easier on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is: if you&amp;rsquo;re setting yourselves great goals for next year, do think as well about the journey to get there. All training but no testing in actual races (smaller races), will not make you more confident in your ability to complete a harder / longer event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;rsquo;ve got a 10K goal, make sure you test yourself at smaller ones. Whether physically or mentally, either smashing it, or just to check that you can complete. &amp;ldquo;Smaller&amp;rdquo; means not only distance, but also &amp;ldquo;lower key&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-12-28-goals-milestones/phoenix_marathon.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Phoenix marathon&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[20141228]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-12-28-goals-milestones/phoenix_marathon_r500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Phoenix marathon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As an example, Ellen completed today the &amp;ldquo;Phoenix Year End Marathon&amp;rdquo;. There weren&amp;rsquo;t many runners, and only a couple of gazebos at either end of the course for aid stations and lap counting. It was a no pressure event, a far cry from the London or New-York events and their thousands of runners, so you could get into your own rhythm without fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ellen ran a Marathon as a milestone? I hear you say&amp;hellip; Yes. Despite me thinking she was &amp;ldquo;the runner&amp;rdquo;, and had all the experience, she had never done one, and needed to get over the mental barrier&amp;hellip;
But a &lt;strong&gt;marathon as a milestone&lt;/strong&gt;? Yeah&amp;hellip; She has entered the &amp;ldquo;toughest footrace on Earth&amp;rdquo; next year. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marathondessables.co.uk/&quot; title=&quot;The Marathon des Sables - The toughest footrace on Earth&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Marathon des Sables&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;: five and a half back to back marathons in six days in the Sahara desert&amp;hellip; As I said: lofty goals! And following this pattern of training and testing her physical and mental strength along the way, I have no doubt my amazing other half will get to her goal next year. Again&amp;hellip; I won&amp;rsquo;t follow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already done so for 2015: set lofty goals for something you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy training for and take part in. And make sure you have intermediate milestones that will help you physically and mentally on your journey to get there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The Wildman off-road duathlon 2014</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;That felt a lot harder than last year on the bike. Having not ridden the MTB at all before the race, it was always going to be hard. Sticky mud and wrong tires didn&amp;rsquo;t make it any easier, but the overall result was faster with a few higher places up the rankings!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Ironman 70.3 UK 2014</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Better late than never, here&amp;rsquo;s my 70.3 UK race report!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-11-11-ironman-70-dot-3-uk-2014/0735_014842.JPG&quot; title=&quot;70.3UK race report&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[2014-06-21]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-11-11-ironman-70-dot-3-uk-2014/0735_014842_r300.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;70.3UK race report&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At last year&amp;rsquo;s 70.3 UK, 3 members of my club &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d3triathlon.com/2013/08/25/d3-goes-to-vegas-ironman-70-3-world-championships/&quot;&gt;qualified for the 70.3 World champs&lt;/a&gt; It was chucking it down: many dropped out during the race, and many more didn&amp;rsquo;t bother staying for the roll-downs, which meant a few surprised athletes got a slot for Las Vegas from pretty deep in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the profile of the course, raining or not, it was one I knew I&amp;rsquo;d enjoy. At least the bike leg. So I registered very early, knowing I could give it a good go, and have potentially the support of my Coach, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jo_carritt&quot;&gt;Jo Carritt&lt;/a&gt;, who&amp;rsquo;s a local. This was also going to be a second 70.3 target to qualify for the worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I stayed at Jo&amp;rsquo;s which made the whole trip very easy. Having two pros in the house (with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laurabostock13&quot;&gt;Laura Bostock&lt;/a&gt;), also made it interesting for a common mortal like me, but no one was too stressed out. Jo initially didn&amp;rsquo;t want to race, but changed her mind when she knew only 3 pro ladies were registered! Knowing she&amp;rsquo;d be in the field spurred me on to do well at the race, as I knew I would (again), have her as a target to catch on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after I registered for this race, I went on to do very well at &lt;a href=&quot;/lanzarote-70-3-2013-hot-windy-hard-yet-the-perfect-end/&quot;&gt;Lanzarote 70.3 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and I qualified for the Canada World Champs over there. 70.3 UK was therefore for me a race without pressure, and all the more enjoyable. I did give it a good go, but possibly not as hard as I would have done without a slot in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-race, reccing the route with Jo and Laura was interesting as well, as they&amp;rsquo;re no slouch in the water or on the bike, and certainly changed from my usual, lonely routine. Getting through the pro briefing, away from the masses was also both easy and enlightening as to what is said in those. Ironman clearly doesn&amp;rsquo;t waste any opportunity to reinforce the fact that they&amp;rsquo;re a brand and they&amp;rsquo;re relying on the pros image to make money&amp;hellip; The level of attempted evangelism was slightly amusing as a non-pro, but a bit cringey given the recent backlashes against WTC, prize purses, and how they seem to look after the ones who should be the stars of the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the water temperature the day before the race was a balmy 19C, with glorious sunshine, with the same predicted for race day: a stark contrast from the previous years!
Racking was dead easy and volunteers chirpy and welcoming, but getting to Wimbleball Lake and getting out of the area was a challenge on its own. Narrow roads, &amp;ldquo;one way system&amp;rdquo; in place for both racking and race day, and no phone coverage whatsoever to tell everyone how pumped I was and send pretty photos of the lake&amp;hellip; At least distractions got out of the way pretty quickly and we could concentrate on the hard stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race day was no different. Everyone at the house was pretty chilled, as I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone had any pressure, and after a 40min drive from Jo&amp;rsquo;s place, we went our own ways to slump in our pre-race nerves.
I met the absolutely gigantic (and massively enthusiastic) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rgactive.com&quot;&gt;RGActive group&lt;/a&gt; who had their &amp;ldquo;team champs&amp;rdquo; on the day, before getting through the last bits of race prep and visualisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in the first wave, so I went down by the lake pretty early. My swimming isn&amp;rsquo;t the best, so I take a little bit of time to visualise how I could get around without leaving too much energy and try to enjoy it.
That&amp;rsquo;s usually before I decide to put myself at the pointy end of the start to get a good get away and try to follow some quick feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again I started at front of the pack, for the most civilised swim I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had in a 70.3. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember being punched, kicked or swam over at all, and that must be a first, especially for a front row start! That didn&amp;rsquo;t mean I was suddenly swimming 22min ahead of everyone (I swam 32!), but rather that the other swimmers weren&amp;rsquo;t in a fighting mood as seen at other races.
I believe having such a wide start line also helps a lot, as it&amp;rsquo;s easier to find free water before the first buoy, by which time everyone has pretty much slotted in their right positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the rankings rankings now while writing this, I was 23rd out of the water in my AG. Surpriiise!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-11-11-ironman-70-dot-3-uk-2014/0735_022347.JPG&quot; title=&quot;Out of the water in my &quot;usual&quot; time&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[2014-06-21]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-11-11-ironman-70-dot-3-uk-2014/0735_022347_r500.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;0735_022347_r300.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Out of the water in my &quot;usual&quot; time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After the age-long run-climb up to transition, akin for me to another great race elsewhere int he UK (The Swashbuckler, in the New Forest), I was in my element, and quickly up on the power to get over with the first climb quickly.
I passed Laura before the left turn at the top and was surprised by that given how good a swimmer she is. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be in a bad place, but knew I had another target further ahead with Jo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I recced some of the route the day before, I had not raced there previously, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what to expect. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple: there isn&amp;rsquo;t a single flat section on the whole bike course. It&amp;rsquo;s up, or down, or steep up, or steep down! You&amp;rsquo;ve been warned if you want to do that race!
I had my &amp;ldquo;Lanza&amp;rdquo; gearing, and when I reached Blight&amp;rsquo;s hill, about 30K in the lap, I barely got over it on a 39x27. And you have to do it all twice!!
Not only is there no flat section, and very steep gradients, there is also more cumulative ascent than at Lanza 70.3, so that course really packs a punch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-11-11-ironman-70-dot-3-uk-2014/0735_013084.JPG&quot; title=&quot;climbing, climbing, and more climbing!&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[2014-06-21]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-11-11-ironman-70-dot-3-uk-2014/0735_013084_r500.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;climbing, climbing, and more climbing!&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;climbing, climbing, and more climbing!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This year, the weather was gorgeous. It was warm, dry, and I could really push it on the bike.
At one point, I sadly lost my front water bottle with all my nutrition in it, so I had to stop and go back for it.
One of the locals there had picked it up and ran towards me which was amazing. This sort of thing makes me really happy and hopeful in that people do embrace the racing around their area. Thanks to them, I didn&amp;rsquo;t lose much time.
I did lose a few places though, as I was battling with the same group of guys around the climbs all the way through until then. I&amp;rsquo;m a mountain goat, so I&amp;rsquo;d pass them on the ups. They were big muscles guys, so they&amp;rsquo;d whizz past me on the downs. With that bottle accident, I had lost them, and my place in the pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it looks like I ended up being 9th off the bike in M30-34&amp;hellip; It was all going quite well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught Jo right while I got into T2. This time, she&amp;rsquo;d out-biked me, and there will be a revenge some day! So it was game over for me in my little personal race against her, as I knew she&amp;rsquo;d totally destroy me on the run.
Despite her shouting at me while she was 2nd lady (thanks coach!), the gap lengthened and I snapped.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve never been to Wimbleball to see the course: don&amp;rsquo;t leave it all on the bike, as the run is worse!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit down mentally during the first lap. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the course, and I walked a fair few aid stations. Someday I&amp;rsquo;ll run the whole damn thing! But I regained conciousness for the last two laps, now that I knew the terrain and where the hard bits were. Jo was long gone, but I was starting to catch guys up, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t think that I was doing too bad.
After seeing Laura&amp;rsquo;s partner at the time, Steven, around the bike course, it was a breath of fresh air to have him shout incomprehensible things at me on the run. He&amp;rsquo;s from &amp;ldquo;the North&amp;rdquo;, you see, so as a Frenchman, I don&amp;rsquo;t get half of what he says when I&amp;rsquo;m racing and puffing my lungs out!
But having him there was something to look forward to every lap, much like the oh-so-noisy RGActive posse who should have won the loudest and craziest cheer crew award of the year at that race. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen so many enthusiastic (and frankly, nuts), people, driving everyone on as they passed.
I managed to run almost all of the remaining hills on the last lap, only slowing down a little bit at the top of the aptly named &amp;ldquo;Steep Lane&amp;rdquo;. The end was in sight, the ordeal almost over, and I felt that I was flying.&lt;/p&gt;

Neeeh, more a grimace!&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[2014-06-21]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-11-11-ironman-70-dot-3-uk-2014/0735_015567_r500.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Is that a smile? Neeeh, more a grimace!&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is that a smile? Neeeh, more a grimace!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It turned out I was flying so well that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything in reserve for the last climb, and that&amp;rsquo;s exactly where I caught another M30-34 who did have some left&amp;hellip; I tried to kick a little as I passed him, but should have buried myself here and then, as he hung on, and had a massive sprint kick when it all levelled up at the top of the last climb. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t follow in the convoluted end funnel before the line, and I let him go. My fun day was over, but I still managed a respectable 5h10'10&quot;, for 15th in my AG. Happy days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great to find Jo not too far in the tent, and even share a bit of her champagne afterwards from a well deserved podium for her usual true grit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest: this race is a perfect playground for hard-core racers. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if the race reputation of being the hardest in the world is true, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly the hardest I&amp;rsquo;ve done to date. Comparing it with Lanza makes the latter look pretty easy if I&amp;rsquo;m honest! The bike is hard with long climbs and wind, but it&amp;rsquo;s not as relentless as Wimbleball. The run, however, is on a totally different level. One you&amp;rsquo;d be wise to respect if you want to do well around the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Thorpe park sprint triathlon 2014</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to have a real go at this one after last year&amp;rsquo;s 4th place overall. Thorpe Park sprint is always pretty fast, but the field is quite small, and it&amp;rsquo;s a fun race at the end of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-09-21-thorpe-park-sprint-triathlon-2014/3_bike.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Putting my head down!&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[20140921]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-09-21-thorpe-park-sprint-triathlon-2014/3_bike_r300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Putting my head down!&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Putting my head down!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The swim start was very fast, and I missed the front pack. I ended up swimming on my own a little bit back, then leading the second pack. My arms were starting to tire half-way through, and that reflected in the time, about 30s down on last year&amp;rsquo;s. It was kind of a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; swim for me, but having made a bit of progress during the year, I had expected a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In T1, I was a little slow to put on my race belt and glasses. So although I didn&amp;rsquo;t make the same mistakes as last year, I clearly lack some sprint training!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bike, the legs didn&amp;rsquo;t feel too happy. I was passing people constantly and at some point one guy shouted at me &amp;ldquo;THIRD!&amp;rdquo;, so I may have been in third at this point. Who knows. Trying to eat a gel ended up with half of it in my mouth, and the other half on the road as I dropped it. Effing stupid packaging that doesn&amp;rsquo;t let the bloomin' thing squirt out of the pouch!! Daft. Anyway. Legs weren&amp;rsquo;t happy, and watts were about 10W lower than last year&amp;hellip; with 2 min down on last year&amp;rsquo;s time. No secret, really!! I even saw Ellen about half way on the bike, and she told me afterwards I looked like I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even trying compared to the others&amp;hellip; The curse of being an LD athlete!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T2 was a bit messy in that I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t put my feet in my shoes quick enough (no socks this time), because they were so cold I couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel them. Again, lack of sprint training shows as preparation should help for those!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the run is where I wanted to nail it. I caught up the guy I thought was 2nd right at the exit of transition, and set off to try and get myself a 17:50-ish 5K. It felt alright, albeit hard, of course, but it ended up being a little short as well. I tried to push harder at the end, but there was no one to chase around the twisty course! But I got a 5K PB and a sprint tri PB for the efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was only 6th overall this year, but to my surprise: 1st in M30-40!
No prize for that sadly, so I&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait before climbing on a podium!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Ironman 70.3 World Championship 2014 - Mont Tremblant - Canada</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Having qualified more than 12 months prior to this race, a lot has had the time to happen in the mean time, and the focus of the 2014 season was initially on longer distance with &lt;a href=&quot;/ironman-lanzarote-2014/&quot;&gt;Ironman Lanzarote&lt;/a&gt; in May. Jo therefore updated my training plan to re-focus on more speed over the summer, with the intermediate &amp;ldquo;target&amp;rdquo; of &lt;a href=&quot;/ironman-70-dot-3-uk-2014/&quot;&gt;70.3 UK in Wimbleball&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-09-07-ironman-70-dot-3-world-championship-2014-mont-tremblant-canada/703_wc_31.jpg&quot; title=&quot;703_wc_31_r300.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[20140907_703_wc]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-09-07-ironman-70-dot-3-world-championship-2014-mont-tremblant-canada/703_wc_31_r300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;703_wc_31_r300.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For the 70.3 WC at the end of my season, I had no stress, no pressure, and, frankly, no real ambition. All I wanted was to enjoy the trip, the experience, and the race itself. I knew on the day I qualified that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to go for a top spot. That wouldn&amp;rsquo;t prevent me from giving it all, but I was just realistic about my abilities in that field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my first time at a World Championship event, I was ready to be amazed! I was ready to be welcomed as an elite athlete and soak it all up. Being with a few friends from &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackline.london&quot; title=&quot;Blackline London&quot;&gt;Black Line London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freespeed.co.uk/&quot; title=&quot;Freespeed London&quot;&gt;Team Freespeed&lt;/a&gt; helped not feeling too lost without the usual support I get from my other half or my dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The athlete&amp;rsquo;s village and expo, however, was frankly rubbish, and not even worth mentioning. I guess manufacturers focus more on Kona, but that village felt even smaller than at other events. The organisation didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like anything special, and I was gob-smacked to see that both transitions were going to be a &amp;ldquo;bags on the floor&amp;rdquo; affair! At a World Championship event!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-09-07-ironman-70-dot-3-world-championship-2014-mont-tremblant-canada/-703_wc_03.jpg&quot; title=&quot;-703_wc_03_r300.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[20140907_703_wc]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-09-07-ironman-70-dot-3-world-championship-2014-mont-tremblant-canada/-703_wc_03_r500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;-703_wc_03_r300.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At least having friends around made it all a nice experience and the days prior to the race were fantastic. The surroundings of Mt Tremblant are wild and very green. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure there&amp;rsquo;s much to do in here other than be outdoors, and with nice roads like that, it was paradise to ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The few days before the race also brought some big doubts over my swim. While the weather was fine 2 days before the race (and it was fun to swim - quite far! - to find the &amp;ldquo;coffee boat&amp;rdquo;) the day before the race was very windy. There was quite some swell (Yes! In a lake!), and having gone around the peninsula from the start to the end of the race swim course, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t fancy going back. I eventually made it, trying to keep sight of speedy Roger and Jane, but that was a hard swim that I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-09-07-ironman-70-dot-3-world-championship-2014-mont-tremblant-canada/coffee_stop.png&quot; title=&quot;coffee_stop_r300.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[20140907_703_wc]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-09-07-ironman-70-dot-3-world-championship-2014-mont-tremblant-canada/coffee_stop_r500.png&quot; alt=&quot;coffee_stop_r300.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It was all very calm on race morning, though, so all my fears had vanished. I just had to do what I usually do. The fog lifted right before the pros started, and I was in the first wave behind that, ready to be mauled, dunked and drowned by fast &amp;lsquo;elite&amp;rsquo; swimmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-09-07-ironman-70-dot-3-world-championship-2014-mont-tremblant-canada/-703_wc_04.jpg&quot; title=&quot;-703_wc_04_r300.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[20140907_703_wc]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-09-07-ironman-70-dot-3-world-championship-2014-mont-tremblant-canada/-703_wc_04_r500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;-703_wc_04_r300.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Fearing that I really wasn&amp;rsquo;t to the level in the swim, I started on the left of the back row to avoid being in the scrum that was going to happen on the right where the buoys were. The scrum avoidance worked, but starting from the back was the wrong idea. Surprisingly, there were quite a few swimmers that looked a lot worse than me, and I had to navigate my way around a couple of packs that weren&amp;rsquo;t moving fast at all. Very strange, and not what I had expected, but it was nice to be mid-pack out of the swim, having not seen to many athletes from the next waves pass by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T1 was quite long, as you have to run all the way from the lake to the tents, and I&amp;rsquo;m pleased with getting around in roughly 5min, with about 1km of running, plus the usual kit-faffing antics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to expect on the bike course. Having driven it at night, arriving a few days before, and only recced the very end, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the long out and back was going to be. It was quite lumpy in places, but nothing hard, with very smooth roads, and only a little wind to start with.
After the balmy 20.4C water, though, the 10C air temperature was initially quite chilly, but that strangely didn&amp;rsquo;t hinder me at all. It was my first outing in the fantastic Fusion speed-suit, and it seems that it worked quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the course wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem, some of the other athletes definitely were. Never have I seen so much drafting in a race. I guess the waves starts format and the relatively comparable speed of people in the swim was always going to make it hard to find some clear road. But some packs of what looked like more than 50 riders weren&amp;rsquo;t even trying not to draft. Disgraceful attitude, drafting and blocking everywhere with little, if any, enforcement. I think the pros did complain about it as well&amp;hellip;
I could understand if, sometimes, at other events, people didn&amp;rsquo;t really get the drafting rules, but not at an event you had to qualify for. There&amp;rsquo;s simply no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to break free of one pack at some point, but the second time, it didn&amp;rsquo;t work. 50 guys in a f**** pack are always going to be faster than you, no matter what. So I let them pass and - with others - complained a few times to marshals on motorbikes coming in the other direction.
Eventually one Marshall came around and carded about 10 guys in one go, but the situation was ridiculous. At a WC event, this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I got to grips with letting the big packs go, I managed to concentrate on my own race and tried to put some Watts down. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel like I had much - possibly due to the cold temperature at the start - but the overall numbers weren&amp;rsquo;t too bad with a 218W NP. A bit under what I had expected, but with a 2h24' bike, I can say I&amp;rsquo;m quite pleased!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 20K of the ride were quite hilly, and I knew it, having ridden it a few days before, but it felt a lot harder than on that training ride. I still passed a lot of the heavy muscle guys (as usual), only for them to pass me again on the way down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usual stuff, really, but pretty swiftly into T2! This one was pretty quick, giving the bike to a handler and only having to pick-up a bag on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt good on the run, and maintained my pace even over the lumps, which I was very happy with. By now, I knew the course like the back of my hand as my accommodation was almost at the turnaround point. I knew where I should hold off a little and where I could push, which helped a lot. That course is definitely not easy! The way into town for example, with the massive climb right at the end of the lap, is pretty steep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking around to see if I could recognise faces during the run, and the only pro I managed to recognise was Sebastian Kienle, who didn&amp;rsquo;t look too good at the time.
Matt Molloy and Roger Barr were obviously pushing hard, but they managed a sign, which was nice in that crazy crowd!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than this, the run was almost a best, only because of a loo stop 2/3 in as I had the trot all week. But otherwise the nutrition seemed to have worked well. It hadn&amp;rsquo;t been too hot on the bike, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t drink all my gels, and in retrospect, it was probably wise, so to avoid further &amp;lsquo;damage&amp;rsquo; on the run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to enjoy my finish, but I almost got knocked over the barriers by an idiot who shoved me aside in the finish chute. Being so far down the rankings, that was just stupid and pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, that race was great. The course was very fast despite the lumps, and if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that far from Europe, I&amp;rsquo;d certainly go back there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, the venue was fantastic, and the race challenging enough. So from a &amp;ldquo;holiday&amp;rdquo; point of view, it was a great trip. Race-wise, however, except for the draft-fest, there was really nothing extra or new that I didn&amp;rsquo;t already experience at other races around the world, so that wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good PB though! Thank you Canada and the people of Mt Tremblant.&lt;/p&gt;
