                <title>2014 Iceman off-road duathlon</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Race 3 of the Human race off road series was the Iceman. Held on January 25th 2014, I was expecting a lot colder conditions than at the previous races, but it was in fact quite mild, and instead of ice&amp;hellip; we had mud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-02-07-2014-iceman-off-road-duathlon/iceman_mud.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Iceman: Done!

&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was slightly disappointed that the Mudman was in fact the &amp;ldquo;Hillman&amp;rdquo;, and there was barely any mud to contend with. Not that my MTB skills at the time could have coped, but I wanted to get dirty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has now been done! Coming out of the iceman, I was properly covered in sticky black stuff, and grinning from ear to ear from having tamed a proper slippery course. 4th proper mountain bike ride at speed, and finally some deep mud!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the weather was so horrendous for the few weeks before the race with flooding everywhere, I elected to steal Ellen&amp;rsquo;s wheels, since they had Contis Mountain King on them, which, even if not proper mud tyres, would work better than my shallower studded ones.
I had a chuckle looking at them with their reflectors and chain guard, but that would prove the point that the machine doesn&amp;rsquo;t play a massive role in having a great race.
At more than 13Kg, I have a heavy entry level bike complete with reflectors and bell. It&amp;rsquo;s obviously no match for full carbon bikes like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JohnBrame&quot; title=&quot;John Brame on Twitter&quot;&gt;John&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; Rose Psycho Path that weighs the best part of 6Kg less (!), but I&amp;rsquo;m having fun :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the morning of the race, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling that well rested after a week of hard training, but the weather helped a lot in feeling better. This time, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t windy or too cold, and the sun was making an appearance, so there would only be a lot of mud to contend with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After waving the RGActive peeps good luck for their trail run, I started the first run conservatively and not too close from the front of the pack. That was intentional so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get too carried away on the first lap. I felt tired on that first leg, and I my left ankle was getting a little twitchy again, so I wanted to be in control of my run. It was pretty hard to start with, with a lot of people around making it difficult to look where to land my feet. But after the first lap I settled into a nice rhythm, including the hills which I mostly walked to make sure I didn&amp;rsquo;t cramp later on in the race. There was a lot of mud and deep puddles that I initially mostly managed to avoid before being inevitably being covered in mud and not caring any-more.
Compared to the Mudman, the course this time had a nicer mix of short very steep hills and long flat-ish portions on which it was possible to recuperate a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my time in T1 as usual. I&amp;rsquo;m in those races for the fun of it, and I was feeling al-right after the run &amp;ldquo;warm-up&amp;rdquo;. Strangely however the bike started with my legs screaming. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why, maybe the lack of brick practice or the week of training, but it took me a little time to settle in any kind of pace. The going went easier and easier each lap and it was fantastic to be greeted every time by the ever cheerful &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RGActive&quot; title=&quot;RGActive on Twitter&quot;&gt;RGActive crew&lt;/a&gt;. No D3 friends this time, but those guys more than make up for it!
There were some deep mud and water sections on/in which I had never ridden before, so I had a few hairy moments where my front or back wheel would slide away from under the bike, but I clung on and didn&amp;rsquo;t fall off this time. It was, on the whole, more technical than the previous races, but like the run, had short steep climbs and longer rolling sections.
Being less relentless than the Mudman, but having great terrain variety and still keeping a nice forest feel throughout the course, that is so far ma favourite ride of the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only had to un-clip once on one of the steep hills as I was in the wrong gear when someone stopped dead in front of me. But that was almost at the top of the climb so that didn&amp;rsquo;t hinder my progress too much.
With the winter turbo training, I have now a lot more power in my legs than when the series started, and I can really feel it since I can power up hills rather than having to push the bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only issue I had (again) on the ride was that I was almost unable to take my bottle out of it&amp;rsquo;s cage. I really need to change that one for racing, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose a bottle. Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 3rd lap, although sometimes caught up in the midst of people one lap down, I kept picking up places regularly, and was feeling better and better.
T2 was a welcome short break before heading out on the final run lap, but I was quite surprised at the low number of bikes in there. There were about 25 bikes in the whole transition area when I arrived, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t far off the front!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I felt tired on first run and couldn&amp;rsquo;t settle initially because of the amount of people around, it was a stark contrast on the last leg, and I was happy to be almost alone for the whole of the second one. Legs were now feeling fine (well, aside the normal race tightness at this stage), and I powered through that last leg, picking up everyone I had in sight. In fact, I picked up 7 places between T2 and the finish, feeling good in the process, so it proves that the strategy to start easy is paying off well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad it&amp;rsquo;s over, but I enjoyed this one a lot more than the Mudman which was a little too hard for comfort at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s now only one race left in the series, and after increasing my ranking every time through the first three races, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to see how far up the series leader boards I can go! I&amp;rsquo;m now 17th overall, 5th in my age group, so it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad for a first dab into off-road racing so far!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>2013 mudman off-road duathlon</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;November 7th 2013: Human race off road duathlon series, race #2. 4 weeks ago was the Wildman and I thought it was hard. Pah! The Mudman was on another level. I&amp;rsquo;ve since been told that this one would be the hardest of the series, so it reassures me that the increasing difficulty isn&amp;rsquo;t a trend as the season progresses, otherwise we&amp;rsquo;d have to prepare harnesses and ropes for the last one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-12-07-2013-mudman-off-road-duathlon/bike1-kib.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Bike: end of lap 1 (Photo Simon Kibble)&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[6423]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-12-07-2013-mudman-off-road-duathlon/bike1-kib_r300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bike: end of lap 1 (Photo Simon Kibble)&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bike: end of lap 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;(photo Simon Kibble)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Set on other MOD grounds than where the Wildman was, this race goes up and down a very steep ridge about 6 times on the run, and tackles it a couple of times on each lap of the bike. A course not for the faint hatred, but that many relish and come out of tired, but with the biggest grin ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I had company from my D3 Club members as Sarah, Christine and Dan were there as well, most of them not having ridden an MTB for ages, Christine even claiming her old one back from her children to do the race. What a fantastic bunch I have as club mates!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On my side, having re-started training properly a couple of weeks before this race, I was feeling a little more confident than on the Wildman, but I still don&amp;rsquo;t have great MTB skills, this race essentially being my second technical MTB ride ever.
I managed to fall only once on a 90deg turn on sand. The front wheel folded. Splat! No harm, just a bit of sand to remove from the brake callipers afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having sweated like anything on the Wildman, and (I think) paid for it on the second run with massive cramps, I elected to go a lot lighter this time. &amp;ldquo;Only&amp;rdquo; two tri shorts for padding, compression gear to protect a bit from the splashes, and only a long sleeve and my tri top. That worked perfectly well in the Wildman, but I did underestimate the amount of heating up that would go on during the first run.
I never did proper duathlons either, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t know. Now, being a lot lighter without all those extra layers, it feels easier too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race was also pretty dry. It should really have been the &amp;ldquo;Hillman&amp;rdquo; rather than the Mudman. With the exception of one 50m trench filled with ankle-deep cold water, plus a couple of puddles here and there, it was all dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started close to the front this time, but very conservatively. Having seen the gradients from transition, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to go nuts from the gun. There are 2 runs in a duathlon, and I now know I need to keep some energy for the second one!
I walked most of the steep uphills, and controlled well the downhills, only letting things go towards the bottom. 6, 7 times? Who knows, it was steep, and there were lots of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-12-07-2013-mudman-off-road-duathlon/run1-kib.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Steep climbs (Photo Simon Kibble)&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[6423]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-12-07-2013-mudman-off-road-duathlon/run1-kib_r300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Steep climbs (Photo Simon Kibble)&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Steep climbs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;(photo Simon Kibble)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So like plenty of others I took relatively my time to go up, and controlled the descents trying not to twist my ankle again.
It was with a bit of a relief that I reached T1, but frankly, I really wondered how I&amp;rsquo;d manage the second run after a 10mi bike ride over the same terrain!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bike was I think a bit more technical than the Wildman, with, in places narrow passages, series of humps like on a BMX track, little ridges of single-track in the middle of puddles of mud, all punctuated with the same up and down than on the first run.
And then there was the water&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I avoided it on the first run, but there was no other way on the bike than to ride through a 50m pond with freezing water. I had a thought or two of walking around, but then thought better of it and just went for it. Almost sprinting through it, the fat front tire was pushing the water aside a little, and I was moving fast. Only the last 5-10m was getting deeper, or with mud underneath which was slowing everything down. 3 laps = 3 ponds&amp;hellip; I would be wet!
Except the one super steep ascent I simply could not ride up, the bike was enjoyable and I liked the technicality of it. You just can&amp;rsquo;t get bored as it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely relentless!
Richie from the RGActive race team passed me on the second lap, smashing through being in his element, and getting up all hills on the bike. Kudos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the atmosphere and the support in places on the course. The RGActive guys pushing you from the hill tops, and trying to spot my fellow D3 club-mates. It&amp;rsquo;s great to have friends around!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting my last lap of the bike, the front of the field was already on the run! At the time I thought that I was very far down the field, but in fact I wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing too bad. These guys were just tearing the course apart!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my time in T2 and set off on the second run knowing full well what was ahead, but surprisingly my legs weren&amp;rsquo;t too bad. I ticked the miles one by one, and ran through the water this time. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter anymore, and I knew I&amp;rsquo;d get warm again very quickly.
I caught up a lot of people on that run, and I trotted up all the hills. Didn&amp;rsquo;t walk any (I think), or very little, on this second run. It felt controlled and I although tired, I was happy and going quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a little left to sprint for the finish, but didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to catch the last guy I could see ahead of me. It turns out he also had some left, but it was great to have this race over! I ran faster by 20s on the second run and that made me very happy to have stuck to a conservative strategy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan, Christine and Sarah were also happy to finish it off, Sarah taking a 2nd spot in her category (how am I not surprised about that?!), but Christine taking a tumble on the bike which bruised her a bit so she didn&amp;rsquo;t have the type of race she usually delivers. But all of us were happy and cheerful at the end. Glad this one was over!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 more races to go in the series, see you at the Iceman on January 25th!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>2013 Wildman off-road duathlon</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;After last winter mostly spent indoors, stuck on a turbo or a treadmill, I thought it would be fun to mix things up and go play in the mud. Alongside registering to a silly event like the Grim challenge, I&amp;rsquo;ve also hit the button to enter the whole of the Human race winter off-road series. Moment of madness? Given how hard the first race was yesterday, probably!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Setting the stage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I had a bike which &amp;ldquo;resembled&amp;rdquo; a mountain bike was about 15 years ago. I never did a &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; mountain bike ride with mud, rocks, lots of ups and downs and technical sections. I bought my current MTB exactly 1 month ago, and did only 70K on it around Richmond park and Wimbledon Common, both of which can be considered flat compared to the Wildman&amp;rsquo;s course.
Last time I did a duathlon (before last week-end&amp;rsquo;s Hillingdon road sprint), was my first multi-sport attempt at the London duathlon (also road based), all the way back in 2007. I had no idea, no training, and 2 years old shoes…
In other words, even with some good base fitness, the Wildman was going to be very hard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Change of weather and kit choice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, last year&amp;rsquo;s Wildman was rainy, and extremely boggy. This year, it was cold, but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much mud. Just one patch on the long loop, and the usual pond on the 5K run. The forecast was right: the car was showing 2C when I arrived at the race, so I layered up a lot! I hate the cold, and with my track record of getting frozen to death and not choosing to wear enough kit, I decided to take no chances this time.
For bottoms, I had tri shorts under long leggings, plus my D3 tri shorts on top of it all for warmth, extra padding and to show the club colours. For the top: a Craft zero extreme wicking layer, a Helly Hansen crew long levee top to take the scratches, and my club tri top to keep the wind at bay. Short gloves under long running ones for the run, all topped with my assos early winter road gloves for the bike. (yes, that&amp;rsquo;s 3 pairs for the bike) Plus a neck buff and a winter cycle hat for the ride.
That&amp;rsquo;s quite some kit and I sweated a bit on the first run on the tail wind portions, but I was happy to have all that on. For me, that was a good choice: I started to feel the cold in the middle of the second run as the sun had disappeared. Some guys were wearing only shorts and tee-shirts. No idea how they do that!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The course&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brutal! There&amp;rsquo;s no other word for it! The run, especially around the start, is up and down all the time, and it&amp;rsquo;s single track. There&amp;rsquo;s virtually no space to pass anyone, and you either seed yourself correctly at the start (Yeah… Like I had any idea!!), or you have to be patient in the line of runners. It opens only after a few Km, and you can then chose a bit more your line, but you&amp;rsquo;ve got to be very careful where you step. I think I may have twisted again my left ankle :-/
Also, there were essentially 4 races in one: a 10 K race, a 15K race with and without dogs, and a duathlon. The duathlon starting 20min after the first 10K race, you keep passing people on the run, some of them with their dogs, which is quite funny to watch (dogs goes right, owner goes left, both end up in the mud…), and also very nice to have as an organised event. A far cry from most of the WTC events I&amp;rsquo;ve raced this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When switching onto the bike, you do 2 laps of the long loop you&amp;rsquo;ve just ran. The same problems arise: narrow in many places, very steep in others, and impossible to pass at some points. There was one steep ascent I don&amp;rsquo;t think I saw anyone climb on their bike. I was glad I had studs under my shoes to push the bike uphill! The super cheap Wiggle DHB M-1 worked a treat!
On the second bike lap, I took a tumble on the very steep, gravely, descent. There was a photographer at the bottom and I really hope he&amp;rsquo;s got good shots of it! Not sure I want to do it again, but it must have been funny as it was quite a slo-mo one. No scrapes on me, just a bit of mud. Moving on!
Interestingly, coming from the road, I had good power on the flat-ish sections and passed a few people, but I was wayyyy too slow on the technical bits. Lack of MTB riding of course, but some of the guys there had either no brain, or the most amazing reactions and handling skills. Some were literally flying pass me on the descents, no brakes, just flat out… On the road I&amp;rsquo;m a good rider on descents. On a MTB, it looks like I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much useless!
Other than this, it was hard going, and it&amp;rsquo;s on another level compared to riding a long distance triathlon. You just cannot, at any time, settle into a rhythm. It&amp;rsquo;s all up/down, stop/go. That&amp;rsquo;s a killer! But that was the point…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second run was simply evil. The first one in comparison, even with its length, was almost easy. Ups are steep, downs are steep. I was tired, tight and I started to cramp severely after going through the freezing pond around the second km. Eventually both my adductors locked up trying to go up a bank that was so steep you needed your hands to go up it. With cramped legs, I was literally stranded there, unable to move for about a minute. Not. Nice!
I also realised 2Km from the end that the &amp;ldquo;roadwork ribbon&amp;rdquo; (the bits of red/white plastic ribbon) was indicating the route… Would have helped to realise that earlier as I took the wrong turn at some point! Dooh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ouch… You think it&amp;rsquo;s hard on a road triathlon? Try off-road! I knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be easy, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect it to be that hard. On the first run, maybe there&amp;rsquo;s no real place/time to take anything on except on the flatter parts on the other sir of the circuit, but on the bike, it&amp;rsquo;s just impossible unless you have everything in a camelback or stop on the side of the track to grab your bottle. My hands were so tight and painful from holding the bars that I had to stop a couple of times to extract my bottle from its cage!
On the second run (especially on that course), there was no respite from the terrain, and no aid station. So take your own, and maybe pause here and there to get something in? Mind you, on the last 5K, it&amp;rsquo;s probably too late anyway.
I also had a very strange thing happen to my drink bottle in that the powder didn&amp;rsquo;t dilute well. I used hot water in the hope to get a not-frozen bottle, but it may have triggered some sort of reaction as it went all lumpy and even blocked the nozzle. I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice until I reached that bit of the bottle mid ride, and therefore couldn&amp;rsquo;t drink anything from roughly half way in the bike leg, which didn&amp;rsquo;t help the second run and the massive cramping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layering up worked this time! Keep it like that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t over-do the first run, the rest of the route is just as hard and you&amp;rsquo;ll need energy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ride more technical terrain! Lack of skills on descents compared to many others was clearly visible!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More hill work needed, both on bike and on foot. Cramping on the second run was probably due to a combination of many things. Too fast first run, lack of MTB riding and subsequent energy expenditure, nutrition not going in due to… err… terrain being to hard, etc. But more hill practice can only help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow red/white plastic ribbon on the run trails so you don&amp;rsquo;t get lost! They&amp;rsquo;re not bits of litter, they&amp;rsquo;re showing you the route!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t use hot water with powdered drinks, or at least try it before a race. Not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s only the brand I use, but that&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m not going to try again!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Bring it on!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was hard. Very, very hard. Off road is relentless! There&amp;rsquo;s no time to admire the view or get lost in your own thoughts. You can&amp;rsquo;t end-up being bored on the bike, and the level is… astounding. But it was also a lot of fun! Brutal fun, but something new that I liked. Ah, and I&amp;rsquo;m not great at it, which is fantastic. So much to learn too!
This was only the first race in the series of 4. The next one is on December 7th, where a few other D3 will apparently also take part! So I&amp;rsquo;ll see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>2013: A first coached racing year. The coach, races and Results.</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;About 11 months ago I started my first personal coached plan with Jo Carritt through the training business she runs with her partner Steven Lord: Every Day Training. 10 months of discovery of what such a plan entails, of performance improvements, and ultimately discovery of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-11-16-2013-a-first-coached-racing-year-the-coach-races-and-results/medals.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Some of 2013's medals haul&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[6392]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-11-16-2013-a-first-coached-racing-year-the-coach-races-and-results/medals_r300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Some of 2013's medals haul&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some of 2013's medals haul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Last year&amp;rsquo;s setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t race a lot in 2012, but given the relatively low amount of training I did, I didn&amp;rsquo;t do to bad. I set PBs in pretty much all the races I has entered early in the year. Half marathon, half ironman, sprint tri with a PB 5K along the way, and also got very close to my Olympic tri PB.
But after this fantastic start, I managed to pick up a nasty knee problem further compounded by a foot injury just a week before the Outlaw, where I initially had big hopes to crush my ironman distance best. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t to be, but I did smash my swim best time by 5 minutes and flew on the bike until having to jog/walk a 4h40 marathon to complete the event.
My last race of 2012 was the 70.3 Lanzarote at the beginning of November. With the knee and foot issues in the summer, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too optimistic given the course profile and the expected wind, but I had a fantastic race and finished 15th of my age group. Even being the first edition of a race with a scary profile (so possibly a bit less competition than usual), 5h12' on the volcano island was a huge confidence boost, and one to culture dreams of getting closer to the top spots, where the 70.3 World Championship slots are awarded.
There and then I had set some goals: go to Vegas! It changed location since then, but although I&amp;rsquo;d really like to test myself against the Nevada desert, that&amp;rsquo;s being part of an event with some of the very best athletes that counts. It could take years, or even never happen, but I had decided I&amp;rsquo;d try to get to the level where I can qualify. Outright or more realistically through roll down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A coached plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coached plan was for me the next step in trying to achieve better than I ever had. To prove myself and others that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more in that body of mine. Granted, some do it on their own and have the discipline to do so, but I&amp;rsquo;m one who sometimes needs a right ol' kick in the butt to get going!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some encouraging words from Paul Smernicki from the BLL guys (Get plan. Do plan, remember? &lt;a title=&quot;Get Plan Do Plan Fly / BLL&quot; href=&quot;http://www.blacklinelondon.com/get-plan-do-plan-fly/&quot;&gt;http://www.blacklinelondon.com/get-plan-do-plan-fly/&lt;/a&gt; ), it&amp;rsquo;s with this in mind that I went on to search for a private coaching plan that would not cost me an arm and a leg, but would also be specific enough to me so it would not feel like another blanket plan some &amp;ldquo;coaches&amp;rdquo; use for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through Training Peaks and their coach/athlete matching program, I had a few good suggestions, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the &amp;ldquo;click&amp;rdquo; that I was after and it all felt a little too much &amp;ldquo;shark attack&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;getting to know each other&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s probably a very personal thing though, and I know TP is working very well for many out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.everydaytraining.org.uk/&quot; title=&quot;Every Day Training&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-11-16-2013-a-first-coached-racing-year-the-coach-races-and-results/edt.png&quot; alt=&quot;Every Day Training&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Having talked to &lt;a title=&quot;Sarah Bowen on Twitter&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SportsMassageSB&quot;&gt;Sarah Bowen&lt;/a&gt; when I was in Lanzarote for the 70.3, she recommended &lt;a title=&quot;Every Day Training&quot; href=&quot;http://everydaytraining.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Every Day Training&lt;/a&gt;, as her own coach is Steven Lord. I contacted EDT after the race and got a response from Jo Carritt, who had room for another athlete to coach at the time. We discussed where I was at, and what where my goals and it felt right straight away. After a few nice exchanges by email, I had a few tests to do in each discipline to check what my current fitness was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was early December 2012 and I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked back since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hitting it hard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had not done that much volume before the last winter and, initially, the quantities that were on the plan looked massive in comparison. Especially the swim sets. I was genuinely scared to enter the pool feeling that the lifeguards would have to fish me out. I distinctly remember being in there one morning and thinking to myself that Jo was only looking to break me. That I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good enough anyway, and that I had reached the point where I should just admit defeat and dial it back to my pre-coached life. It was only a 2K set! But there were a lot of them! How more wrong could I be!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By keeping in mind the &amp;ldquo;get plan, do plan&amp;rdquo; moto, I got through it. I also have the chance (and sometimes the curse) to live with possibly the most self-driven person I know. Ellen has been going through this with me, and managed to cope with my initial tiredness and lack of attention to small things at home. I do know she kept it to herself at the time. I had also changed jobs recently when I started the plan and was commuting a lot more than before, so there was a lot to adjust to!!
But after the initial shock (the sought after kick in the backside) I settled into a rhythm with my eyes firmly set on my first big race of 2013: ironman Lanzarote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this, I managed to set a new half marathon PB at Wokingham (by 4min!!), and through a lot of turbo work (early 2013 was perfect for outdoor enthusiasts, right? Note sarcasm…), got to know myself more on the bike and have good power figures to target at the coming races.
As Jo did put it, I would have a love/hate relationship with the turbo sessions. I think it was alright initially, and except annoying the neighbours, I got on quite well with power and pedalling technique both getting better. This was early in 2013, and the weather getting better gradually helped translate this into some nice road sessions and solo TTs around Richmond park. Power work would get tedious later in the year though, going on the road to do long race prep intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the year, I could already see the benefits of &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; training. With 3 swims a week, 3 runs, 3 bike sessions including power development and a long ride at the week-end, it was  a lot more than anything I&amp;rsquo;d done previously, but all was going very well in all 3 disciplines. I&amp;rsquo;ve clocked more long rides and long runs than in almost the entirety of 2012, and I even started to actually enjoy running at some point, looking forward to get out of the door for a long one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disaster?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was until the first week-end in March doing some off road hill reps, where an old injury came back. Twisting my left foot a week prior to the Outlaw 2012 had finally caught up, and I was forced to forget running (and initially also kicking in the pool), for the best part of a month. With only 1.5 months to what I thought would be the biggest race of my life, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my lovely other half happens to be a physio &lt;a title=&quot;Ellen Physiotherapy&quot; href=&quot;http://www.physioellen.co.uk/ &quot;&gt;http://www.physioellen.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;, and one who&amp;rsquo;s specialising in sports rehab. Not that I want to get injured at all, but I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to have had Ellen&amp;rsquo;s support for getting back to running. With Jo tweaking the plan and Ellen giving me some stability exercises, I slowly went back to walking fast, then using a run/walk strategy both in training and racing at Lanzarote.
That was the big race on my calendar, and even with the injury before, I still had a fantastic day concluded with a 3h29' run/walk marathon. I equaled my fastest iron distance time on a tough course, with my dad for witness. Training hard paid off big time. 10h37, 25th in AG and 117th overall. How about that for a training and rehab plans that work!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Too much, too soon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Lanzarote over, I then made the mistake to go too hard in the Swashbuckler two weeks afterwards. It was too close but I had registered for it a year before, well ahead of registering for Lanza 70.3 and full IM, and I was supposedly only going to have fun with the guys from my club. I actually had a fantastic race! But instead of holding back, I stupidly smashed it. And in doing so I smashed myself and had massively underestimated the drain Lanza had been. I was feeling fine in the interim 2 weeks with a very much reduced training load, and had fallen into the common trap of overdoing it. This had some bad effects on my return to training after that, feeling ran down, and not motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one word of advice: listen to the coach! Mine&amp;rsquo;s clever, focused, dedicated and, boy, she knows what she&amp;rsquo;s talking about.
But that said, even if Jo has had some steering in my training and adapted some of the sessions due to my injuries, she&amp;rsquo;s never tried to stop me from doing the races I had entered, and did let me do my own mistakes. Intentionally or not, this has been very formative too, as I&amp;rsquo;m now more likely to pay attention to HOW I race as much as how often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Be flexible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a little bit of a breather after the Swashbuckler, my next race being 5 weeks away for the Outlaw, where I was initially only going to do the bike leg of a relay. Having done all the miles, a long race, and plenty of power work, I was very much looking forward to blitz my 112miles bike record. Unfortunately, the team runner got injured too and went on to do the bike instead, while I accepted to do the run. Initially a bit hesitant, it went on alright. It was a very hot day and I waited for the best part of 45min in the sun for our cyclist to come back, so conditions weren&amp;rsquo;t ideal. Adding to this a narrow course in places and shredding the upper of one shoe to bits at the half way mark, I can consider myself happy with a 3h17' in the end. We adapted the training plan with this goal in mind as soon as we knew we had to switch legs in the race, and Jo has done a great job there as well to accommodate the change!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New records, but devil is in the details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the long break. Long break from racing that is. 2 months far in the distance was 70.3 Zell Am See. A supposedly fast course set in beautiful Austria. With a second marathon under my belt in 7 weeks, it was with relief that the training plan adjusted a bit more towards cycling, while keeping focus on speed work for the run so I&amp;rsquo;d get a little closer to the 1h30 on the &amp;frac12; marathon. And it worked! No, It worked superbly well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only did I swim my fastest 1.9K race ever, I also biked my fastest 90K and ran my Fastest 70.3 half mara ever too! Previous record of 4h55 got destroyed in the pouring rainy of Austria, and even if 4h39' is something I&amp;rsquo;m likely to keep as a record for a while, it could have been a lot better. Transitions, transitions transitions! Something to add to your training routine if it&amp;rsquo;s not already there! It wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of mine, especially for such stupidly wet and cold conditions, and because I wanted to have a few layers on, I&amp;rsquo;ve wasted more than 13minutes in T1 and T2 combined… I should have worn something under my wetsuit, and that&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ll try and correct this coming year! But I should have known before the race, and more importantly: practiced! Sicne that race, I made a point into racing with fast transitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a sprint triathlon before my last 70.3 race of the year, it was the perfect time to practice being quick through T1 and T2. That was a fun, no pressure, race, and I had a blast to get a new sprint tri PB, while practicing swimming with layers under my wetsuit and very fast transitions required by this style of racing.
That set me up well for the last assault to a 70.3 top 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Icing on the cake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70.3 Lanzarote was a month earlier than last year, but it still felt far at the end of the racing calendar. I was still training hard and following the power intervals on the plan, but these were increasingly becoming tedious and un-motivating. It really was time for the season to end. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have as good a race as last year, feeling wise, but I reached the goals I had set to myself in the lead up: sub 5 hours over the renown hard profile of the volcano island, and a top 10 in my age group.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure these fantastic results were expected by anyone, including myself, but even more surprisingly, the 4 slots available in M30-34 went all the way down to 11th place!
Year 1 of coaching, last race of the season, and achieving all the dreams I could think of already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thank you coach! Thank you very much!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 months after I started with Jo and after thinking numerous time she&amp;rsquo;d kill me in the process, I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished things I would have never thought I&amp;rsquo;d be able to do. At least not so soon! And for squeezing out some of the very best of myself this year, I can only thank her!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s do it all again!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m now at the end of my &amp;ldquo;rest period&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;ve already kick-started my 2014 season with back to back week-ends of racing duathlons. Two weeks ago was the Hillingdon autumn road duathlon on their road circuit, where I&amp;rsquo;ve done too many laps on the bike and still didn&amp;rsquo;t do too bad. (My brain is now back on!)
This morning was the first off-road duathlon in the Human race series, the Wildman, just for fun! That was fantastic, and incredibly hard! Last time I rode a mountain bike was probably 15 years ago, I never did it &amp;ldquo;for real&amp;rdquo; on mud or rocky terrain, so it was a whole new experience for me! There&amp;rsquo;s plenty to learn in there as well, and although I&amp;rsquo;m not hoping to top the rankings or make it what I will do in the future, it&amp;rsquo;s a welcome change from the road boredom I experienced on those long solo power interval rides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, I&amp;rsquo;ve signed up for another year with Jo, and the first month of my training programme just arrived&amp;hellip; Chop chop!!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>New Toy!</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was bored last winter. Turbo trainer and treadmill didn&amp;rsquo;t cut it!
This year I decided I&amp;rsquo;d go play in the mud, and with this lovely entry level Boardman, I should be able to do just this!
I&amp;rsquo;m already registered to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://humanrace.co.uk/events/off-road&quot;&gt;HumanRace Off-road winter series&lt;/a&gt;, which will hopefully break the monotony of road triathlon training!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Lanzarote 70.3 2013 - Hot, Windy, Hard. Yet the perfect end.</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;After Ironman 70.3 Zell Am See 5 weeks before Lanzarote, both Ellen and I fell ill for the whole of that time: never ending cold from being soaked through on race day, then frozen on the plane journey back, then in the midst of the september bug that always catches everyone out around the offices. This Lanzarote race couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been set-up worse for us, but the weather couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been more different either&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-10-13-lanzarote-70-3-2013-hot-windy-hard-yet-the-perfect-end/0526_00743.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Finish line!&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[6345]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-10-13-lanzarote-70-3-2013-hot-windy-hard-yet-the-perfect-end/0526_00743_r300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Finish line!&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finish line!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Given this and some knees niggles for my other half, It&amp;rsquo;s not with the highest optimism that we flew out to the volcano island once again, but it was the end of both our racing years and was always going to be a bit of a drag to get there. Also, having both won a free entry into the race, it would have been a crime not to go for some sunshine when it&amp;rsquo;s all starting to &amp;ldquo;freeze&amp;rdquo; in the UK. The race date (1 month earlier than last year) was also a perfect fit for an end of season dash with some hopes for me to get closer to the top spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived late on Thursday evening on the island. So late in fact that we barely had time to buy something for breakfast the next day before rushing to our apartments place… That had shut almost a full hour before, right at the time we landed. The strong winds in this part of the world had already started to play tricks on us by slowing right down our plane!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a very restless night in the heat, we had little time to wander around! We went to do registration in the morning (Ellen on her bike… 65K hilly return trip in the 30kph wind to get used to the island… Yep!) to get transition kit bags and the massive bag of advertising that pretty much all went to the bin straight away. Then went back to the cheep and cheerful Puerto del Carmen to do a bit of bike/run race prep for me, then stuff said bags with our bike and run kit, before heading back to La Santa for the briefing and swimming the lap of the course. The water was like a bath, having been heated all day long, but quite choppy with the strong wind at that time of the day.
We also had the bike with us so we could rack them straight after. There was really not time for gaffing about, and for once I&amp;rsquo;m glad our &amp;ldquo;tri-machine&amp;rdquo; is well oiled and we know what to do! Talk about a busy pre-race day! Really not ideal to rest and relax the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a leaf out of  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onehundredandthree.com/&quot; title=&quot;Norman Driskell&quot;&gt;Norman Driskell&amp;rsquo;s book&lt;/a&gt;, I had packed very light transition bags this time to minimise what I had to do in the changing tent. I wanted fast transitions, and that meant putting absolutely nothing unnecessary in the bags, which seemed to have worked! One doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually need much out there! Well, providing it&amp;rsquo;s sunny and warm that is…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at our flat and after a spot of lunch, I had hoped my little tracker tool would work so friends and family could follow both Ellen and I easily, but since there were no live tracker available (even on the very morning of the race!!), I was sorry to admit defeat against yet another poorly run Ironman website. The main site all looks new and shiny now, but there&amp;rsquo;s still no substance to it… Anyway, it eventually went live towards the end of the race (!!), but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very useful either since there were no bike splits either. No Tabayesco climb TT this time, why? It would have been nice to compare the two years! Utter rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the race, the morning drive to Club La Santa wasn&amp;rsquo;t as bad as anticipated. I&amp;rsquo;d have thought it would take me completely out of my &amp;ldquo;zone&amp;rdquo;, but it actually allowed me to wake up a little more. It may not work for all, but if you race the 70.3 and have a car on the island, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend to not bother paying premium prices at La Santa, and instead get some self catering accommodation in Puerto del Carmen and drive over. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot cheaper!! (And I really mean A LOT!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the swim leg, this year&amp;rsquo;s course had been changed from a two laps affair to a single loop in the shape of an inverted &amp;ldquo;L&amp;rdquo;. That was mostly a very good idea, which avoided the potential dangers of fast swimmers lapping the back of the age group field on the second lap, and easier to understand. However, the &amp;ldquo;kink&amp;rdquo; in the lagoon was still there, on the left side this time, right by the swim exit, and it caught a lot of people out on the first lap. It was actually about 400m in the swim, where the &amp;ldquo;pack&amp;rdquo; was still very much jolting and hustling for position, and many actually ended up walking on the sand banks by the swim exit. Not great for the rest of the swimmers, but our recce from the previous day prompted me to do the exact same thing than last year: Start in the middle, and stir away from the bank! Ellen later told me that there also has been some sort of panic and screams further down the field and that she had to swim around a large pack of stranded, walking athletes to get through. Improvements over last year, certainly, but more to be done. It will come I&amp;rsquo;m sure!
Starting around the middle of the pack, around 4/5 rows from the front, I managed to avoid much of the elbows and didn&amp;rsquo;t get too much swam over. I&amp;rsquo;m a fighter now, so don&amp;rsquo;t mess with me because I don&amp;rsquo;t back out of it anymore! After we all passed the &amp;ldquo;swim exit kink&amp;rdquo;, it all cleared out with more space for swimmers to fan out, but I kept my line and managed to swim straight at the first buoy. I would literally hit all buoys dead on this time! Big improvement!
The water was warm. Not as choppy as the previous day, but not all flat either, thanks to the strong established wind from early on in the day. This wind, combined with the rising sun, didn&amp;rsquo;t help sighting on the return from the far out buoys, but I managed to not go off route too much, only occasionally having to do corrections on the long stretch back towards the bottom of the course. There weren&amp;rsquo;t many swimmers around me anymore, which, combined with the few I could spot ahead, told me I was having a good swim, much like in Austria, where I believe I led a little group back towards the exit. I passed all buoys within centimetres this time, and I&amp;rsquo;m well chuffed for that! I&amp;rsquo;m usually wayyy out to keep clear of crazy arms, but not this time! And with a good feeling in the water, I believe it helped getting sub 30min for the very first time! The tracker says 30'09&quot;, but given that I started swimming a couple of seconds after the gun, and the timing mat was not right out the water, but a bit further up the bank from the water, I was just under 30min (Well, my watch says so! Ha!). Hap-py!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T1 was at last the quick dash I always wanted. If there was one thing I really needed to nail at this race, it was my transitions. I&amp;rsquo;ve had enough of being too slow and losing rankings like in Austria, and I&amp;rsquo;m well pleased with both of them. T1 in 2'32&quot; includes the long slog up the bank from the water, and T2 includes putting socks on and running around 100m of the track, so yay for my transitions this time! Granted there was nothing to put on in T1 but a helmet, and some peeps manage to run a half marathon without socks, but 4'42&quot; of cumulative transition time doesn&amp;rsquo;t even compare with nearly 13 minutes in Austria! I was quickly on the bike, where I really hoped my legs would do their usual wonders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;rsquo;t. The bike didn&amp;rsquo;t go as easy as I remembered it to be. Last year was a real breeze in comparison, and although I cramped a little on the way back at the time, it was all controlled and felt fantastic. Not this year. I wanted to keep on top of my target wattage, and it all worked well all the way after the Mirador de Haria descent, about 65Km in. Power was there, but legs weren&amp;rsquo;t, really. From the gun, they felt heavy and screaming, and the climb out of Famara, even with the tailwind, didn&amp;rsquo;t go like the previous two times I raced up it, including after 80K in the full distance in May. There was no need to panic at this point, but I really didn&amp;rsquo;t like it so early on.
The descent from Teguise to Tahiche was the first time I got a taste of my bigger gear ratio, and unlike last year I could pretty much pedal all the way down with my 11 teeth at the back. Yay! But as soon as we turned left towards Arieta, the same leg sluggishness came back in, this time a strong headwind, all the way up north the island! Nicely though, I found myself playing cat and mouse with the eventual 40-44 winner, Simon Gill as I was going past him up the inclines, and he was going past on the descents. I love the fact that he even apologised for passing me at some point saying that &amp;ldquo;he wasn&amp;rsquo;t taking the piss&amp;rdquo;, as we were exchanging positions regularly. Nice touch! It was good to have a carrot to chase along the way and also good to feel that my legs were back at this point.
They loosened up nicely just before the turnaround point at Arieta for the Tabayesco climb, which I enjoyed a lot yet again. There was a bit of a tailwind in the valley, it was a bit like a cauldron in some of the turns, and I was sweating a lot. Probably a lot more than expected, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice until later in the ride.
The descent from Mirador de Haria was as ever super speedy. Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t reach my last year&amp;rsquo;s top speed, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too far off, but I wanted to be careful as there was more wind this time around. Under 58Kg rider with deep rims in 20knts of wind isn&amp;rsquo;t all the time easy, especially at 80kph down a mountain on tri bars!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s after this first set of switchbacks, in the little incline getting out of Los Valles that the first signs that something was not right appeared. My right adductor was starting to cramp, so much so that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put much power through my right leg while sat, and even standing and pedalling in awkward positions didn&amp;rsquo;t change much to it. I managed to get on the road towards the descent to Teguise, but had to unclip and try to stretch that leg, not very successfully I have to admit.
Going through Teguise and its crap road got my mind of it, but in the strong headwind back to Famara I really had to lift off the power to manage the cramps that were now spreading to my left leg too. Horror of horrors! There was still 15K to go, and it all went tits-up after Famara, and I eventually had to stop. Yes! STOP. Unclip, apply brakes, stop bike, try to stretch. And that&amp;rsquo;s a horrible feeling! Guys from the race pass you, guys on a little training ride pass you, the local donkey passes you. And there&amp;rsquo;s nothing you can do to get back on the saddle because your legs are rock solid, locked in pain. I eventually managed to get going after the riders I passed on the climbs passed me back, and after taking in more water, salts and gels, went on to complete the ride. It was still 5minutes faster than last year, but what a shame it didn&amp;rsquo;t go as planned! Again, I was relieved to finish the bike leg and see what was left in the tank, but after such a disastrous last 20K on the bike, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t hope for much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T2 was fast too, and still promising given the very low number of bikes back in the stadium! As a non-pro you never know where you are in the field, but I thought there must have been around 50 bikes maximum back on the racks. That also meant an empty transition tent and another speedy exit, with my socks on! No fuel belt either, but two gels that I hoped I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t lose like I did in Austria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial 7Km went quite fast. Good tailwind to go down to La Santa and the turnaround, taking on sponges and coke at every possible occasion, but I knew it would be a hard run from the moment I hit that dreaded little climb back up to the stadium. That&amp;rsquo;s where my legs went solid last year. Psychological negative effect: 100%! Just. Keep. Moving. I slowed down a little, taking smaller steps, and the premises of cramps went away. First lap done, first band collected. First gel in, some coke, some more sponges, and a good old look around me all the time to spot numbers in my age group.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember my AG number range, but I did spot a Danish runner about 50m behind me with a number around 250, so definitely in it. That gave me a good kick up the backside and I had him on my mind all the time from there on. I was never in this position before, but a quick glance at my watch and the race clock at the finish line told me I could just about get to 5h if I kept at it! The wheels buckled a little at the second time I passed the &amp;ldquo;hill&amp;rdquo;. This time cramps were back and I had to walk a bit. Not stop! No, I did not stop! I just took my time up that damn incline! The Dane passed me. Arghh!!! By the time I started running again he was about 100m up the road, but he was now my ultimate target. 7Km to go and only one &amp;ldquo;hill&amp;rdquo;, with one Dane to catch! Easy to spot in bright orange as well!
I picked the pace back up along the way. Nothing stellar, really, but I was trying to shelter behind faster runners on their first or second lap, and even hang on some super speedy ones for a few controlled and focused strides. It helped the pace, not so much the legs! But I hung on and past my &amp;ldquo;target&amp;rdquo; before the last turnaround in La Santa. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure he was in the same state of mind I was in, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see him again after that. In my head were my goals for the day: top 10, and trying to get to the magic 5h mark on a hard course!
&lt;a title=&quot;Dan Phillips on twitter&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheIngenieur&quot;&gt;Dan Phillips&lt;/a&gt; also gave me a good few shouts out on the run course and that was fantastic to see that he was having a great race as well. Plenty more in these young legs to come I&amp;rsquo;m sure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pushed hard (I think) after the last slow jog up the hill, checked behind me for a potential sprint finish but there was no one there so I did not grunt or grimace this time and high-fived the few extended hands in the finish chute. 4h58'53&quot;: one box ticked. After a lot more cramps than usual and an up-and-down run, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it, but there it was! Checking the time boards a little later told me I was 10th in my age group! Mission accomplished! I came to Lanzarote for a top 10 in my age group and a sub 5h and I got what I wanted! Happy times!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew Dan wasn&amp;rsquo;t too far behind, about 25min given where I was crossing him on the run lap, so I hung out in the finish area to give him a push too. I was also wondering where I could check for Ellen&amp;rsquo;s times on the bike. I had not seen her on the run course like last year. I was really gutted for her back then, but this time, she wasn&amp;rsquo;t around, so she must have been out on the bike course. I was sure she was somewhere out there giving the wind and the heat the two fingers she&amp;rsquo;s too polite to give to anyone doubting her, and I wanted to know where she was! And righty-oh she popped into the stadium at just before the 5h30 mark, 15min in the time limit of 5h45! Damn her she made my cry a little behind my sunnies for being so awesome and going do everything she aims for! Well done darling! So chuffed!
She then said: &amp;ldquo;I bloody hate this place, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be back to finish what I started!&quot;… I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll be back next year then!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan&amp;rsquo;s friends all finished shortly after and we all figured on the live tracker as a happy group of finishers (although wrongly labeled as being from Italy!!!) Happy indeed! Tough day out there, but all go around what we had planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was 10th in my age group and with that there was a slim chance to get a roll down world champs slot. So despite the usual itchiness and impatience of my other half, we stayed at Club La Santa after the race to go to the slot allocation. During that time, sitting around a nice steak and chips at the crowded grill in La Santa, we bumped into the Dane that finished right behind me in my age group! We exchanged a few things about the race and the placements, and of course the slot allocation. I&amp;rsquo;d have to be lucky to get one, but he was one more place down.
The women&amp;rsquo;s slot went all pretty much to the first of each age group without a hitch, but the same can&amp;rsquo;t be said for the men!
Some slots got re-allocated, and after a little bit of confusion over to which age group, it turned out during the allocation that one slot got transferred to my group! Heck, I hoped for a roll down, but the odds were getting better!
One unfortunate guy who finished on the podium in his category got denied a slot because he had selected &amp;lsquo;No&amp;rsquo; to the question &amp;ldquo;do you want to qualify for the WC&amp;rdquo; on his entry form. This, and the crazy and totally misplaced display of the Austrian guy next in line wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly setting up the mood very well. I guess such is the way things go in a competitive field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my group&amp;rsquo;s results came around, the first two guys took their slot. Two slots left, still 8 places from me. Given how all other age groups had gone, I though it was it! But the 3rd guy wasn&amp;rsquo;t there to accept his slot. Neither were the 4th, the 5th or the 6th! It was getting a little tense and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I was starting to look quite nervous at this point, because the guys across the table from where we were seated had a laugh at the fact I might get the very slot that was initially wrongly re-allocated to their AG. Number 7 wasn&amp;rsquo;t here either&amp;hellip; Just one more! And just as I said this to Ellen, my name was called! Number 8 must have said &amp;lsquo;No&amp;rsquo; on his entry form too, so I was taken by surprise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! Yes! Yes! I&amp;rsquo;m going! That might be my only chance! Yes! Yes! Here! Yes! Where do I sign?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there were 4 slots in my age group with the re-allocation, Thierry, our new Danish acquaintance got one slot as well! So we&amp;rsquo;ll meet again in Canada next year!
As crazy as it sounds, only in my age group did the slots rolled down to 11th place. Top spots claimed their slots in all other groups, including Dan&amp;rsquo;s 25-29, who got one place better than me with 9th. It will come for him I&amp;rsquo;m sure if he keeps at it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what a stroke of luck to finish this season. A really far from perfect race on the two legs I thought I didn&amp;rsquo;t think could go wrong, but all goals achieved and a nice little surprise at the end!
One year too late to say &amp;ldquo;Vegas baby!!&amp;rdquo;, but the feeling is the same. I&amp;rsquo;m going to the World Champs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s now time to relax and enjoy some much deserved rest. This season has had a lot of ups and downs, a host of great results that are testament to a good coaching plan from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joannacarritt.co.uk/&quot; title=&quot;Jo Carritt&quot;&gt;Jo Carritt&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydaytraining.org.uk&quot; title=&quot;everydaytraining.org.uk&quot;&gt;Every Day Training&lt;/a&gt;, and some determination to take things slowly, but further than ever before. It&amp;rsquo;s exciting to prove oneself wrong on all levels of &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can do that&amp;rdquo;, and sure there&amp;rsquo;s plenty more in the bag.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Thorpe park sprint triathlon</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Report from a little sprint race added late in the calendar as a &amp;ldquo;ESC D3 club championships&amp;rdquo;. A full on blast trying to nail transitions&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-09-30-thorpe-park-sprint-triathlon/D3_3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;The D3 team on the day&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[6330]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-09-30-thorpe-park-sprint-triathlon/D3_3_r300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The D3 team on the day&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The D3 team on the day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The ESC D3 club champs were initially going to be held at the Big Cow sprint race. Unfortunately, the presence of blue-green algae in the lake led in the first place to the swim leg being cancelled and the event being changed to a duathlon, then completely cancelled due to the amount of entries cancellations and resulting low level of participation.
Keith from D3 found the Thorpe lake race with about a week to go to the date, and with a very nice race director we managed to get guaranteed entries for our club event.
I would have liked everyone who was registered in the Big Cow sprint to race at Thorpe (arguably a lot closer too), but out of the original 36 entries, only 14 registered for Thorpe. Lazy buggers!!
Nevertheless, the club kit got a good showing, and we had a good scrap out on course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had in mind to go as hard as I could on this race. A short sprint to blow out the cobwebs a couple of weeks before Lanzarote 70.3! Matthew being under 30 got an early start, 10 minutes ahead of me. The goal was of course for me to close the gap, and maybe catch him if he was going slow. That was great to have this goal in mind, especially on the run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered the water with the first guys of my wave, which prove to be a little too early as I quickly lost the advantage of my warm-up given the water temperature. A lot colder than the 17C expected! But I was for once at the front of the pack (on a sprint race, scary!) and when the horn went off, I managed to hold my line reasonably well on the left side of the pack. About 10 guys stormed ahead past the first buoy, but I was surprisingly leading the chase pack. That never happened to me before, and it was enjoyable to not be battered and bruised all over before the first turn! In fact, I got clear waters all the way to the end from the first buoy. For me, in the male 30-39 AG on a sprint race, this is unheard of!
The thing that wasn&amp;rsquo;t so clear was the water. So. Much. Weed! In places, it was almost possible to pull oneself along tugging on them, and I had to make a conscious effort to keep going and keep my stroke when going through these patches. Forget the cold water, those were like jungle survival moments where a machete would have been useful!
Nevertheless, I reached the steep bank in 12'37 (at my watch), with no one around to push aside getting out the water like most sprint races I&amp;rsquo;ve done. About what I can swim right now. I&amp;rsquo;d have liked a bit faster as this was a sprint, but I have longer objectives coming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support out the water was amazing with the next waves waiting to get in the water, and I heard quite a few D3 shout-outs! I was about 30s behind Justin and Carl was hot on my heels!
I nailed T1. No socks, only a helmet to pop on, and off I went. That was a lot better than any other T1s I had this year, and one to replicate in Lanzarote 70.3. I must be fast in transitions! No excuses!
I tried a few new things at Thorpe as well: a compressport tri top under my club kit to see if it would impede my swim (it didn&amp;rsquo;t but I was baking later on in the race), and new tri shoes without a stupid boa system. Those worked al-right, but it took me a little while to get my feet in them, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t used to them just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-09-30-thorpe-park-sprint-triathlon/9914833863_ffa54d107a_c.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Out of T1&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[6330]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-09-30-thorpe-park-sprint-triathlon/9914833863_ffa54d107a_c_r300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Out of T1&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Out of T1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Getting out of the park was a bit twisty, but that where I started to pick up athletes ahead, or from the previous wave. Going out on the main road I could put the power down straight away, and within 500m I had reeled in the 30s Justin had on my out of the swim.
I had recced the route the day before, so I knew where to be careful and where I could change lanes to not waste time arriving at roundabouts. That did prove handy to get over the motorway bridges and got flat out all the way around. I spotted Matthew on his way back from the turnaround point and it seemed he was only 4 to 5min ahead of me! IT was going to be close to catch him up and at this point I was determined to do so!
I blasted through the 21Km in 33'02&quot; which was the second fastest bike split of the day, and just shy of 40Kph average, which is what I was aiming for. The little details where I lost time were going out and coming back into transition. I removed my feet of my shoes way too soon and did pretty much the whole in-road into the park to T2 with feet on top of my shoes. Not ideal, but better than others who completely lost their shoes on that road!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-09-30-thorpe-park-sprint-triathlon/9914868004_31d29bc320_c.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Almost there!&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[6330]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-09-30-thorpe-park-sprint-triathlon/9914868004_31d29bc320_c_r300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Almost there!&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Almost there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I almost missed the dismount line as it was right after a hard left turn, but didn&amp;rsquo;t pick up any penalty there. I just mucked up T2 by running out the wrong way in the transition area (a first for me) and losing precious 10 seconds there! But Helen (Matt&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend who was our usual amazing D3 supporter ;-) ) had told me right at the entrance of T2 that Matthew was a bout 2min ahead! Game on!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to hit the run very hard and so I did. I knew I could push given the interval training I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing regularly on my training program so I knew I could hang on at about 3'40&quot; to 3'50&quot; /Km, which I did with a race PB of 18:50. I had a little bit of a lull in the middle with my pace dropping on the third Km, but where I lost most my time was at the very start. I had to stop to adjust my timing chip strap that was digging in my Achilles. Argh! Nevertheless, I had spotted Matthew about 500m ahead of me before the turnaround, and I was pushing hard to catch him up. I got passed with about 1Km to go. The only one who passed me on the day after the swim start, but boy he was fast! That guy (Djalil Bajou from H3 Performance Nottingham) ran 16'27&quot;, so needless to say I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t go with him!
One last push for the remaining twisty bit under the park attractions and I was home in 1h07'21&quot; with a new sprint PB, a new 5K PB in a triathlon, and (unknown to me at the time) a 4th place finish!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1h07' is nothing stellar by national standards, but with a season targeting middle distance and long course racing, I&amp;rsquo;m delighted with that time! I didn&amp;rsquo;t catch Matthew in the end, he was still about 30s ahead of me, but that race inside the race provided great motivation to push harder than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the D3 athletes had a fantastic day, with our ever-speedy iron lady Sarah grabbing yet another Female Vet top spot, and Christine being only 13 seconds behind her, a week after racing the world champs finale in Hyde Park! Also, being so speedy in they age group, they got the top spots in our handicap-adjusted club results. There&amp;rsquo;s no moving these two from these places, and alongside the other D3 finishers, that was a fantastic little club outing.
I hope there will be many more like that!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Ironman 70.3 Zell Am See 2013 - The wet one</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Ellen and I registered for the Ironman 70.3 Austria in Zell am See a very long time ago. But like all races, it seemed to creep in on us very quickly at the end of a summer of hard training. We arrived in Zell am See on Thursday. Although it&amp;rsquo;s very easy access from Salszburg airport with about 1h15 of very easy driving and only one road change, there may have been direct flights to Munich which could have saved an airport transfer. But even with a stopover in Frankfurt, it was a non-stress travel and we had two fantastic days before the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Zell am See is a gorgeous place. It looks like there are hundreds of Km of ski slopes and XC ski tracks around for winter, and loads of roads and MTB tracks for summer, along with the beautiful lake and an absolutely gorgeous, lush, green nature surrounding it. Although we stayed only a few days, we&amp;rsquo;re keen to come back for more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-09-14-ironman-70-3-zell-am-see-2013-the-wet-one/IMG_3013.png&quot; title=&quot;IMG_3013&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[6275]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-09-14-ironman-70-3-zell-am-see-2013-the-wet-one/IMG_3013_r300.png&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_3013&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;During these couple of days we managed to get in a check of the swim course in water that didn&amp;rsquo;t feel as warm as they were saying it was, a few short laps around the lake on the bike, plus one full lap of the bike course. That one is flat. Yes, flat! (Ok, some will say undulating&amp;hellip; for me it was flat) We&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of the mountains with numerous 3000m peaks around us, and the race course is flat! The course was changed from last year to avoid a cobblestone section that was probably dangerous in the wet, and it also got lengthened on the far south-west end. As this was not changed on the map, we missed the false-flat going down to and back up from the turnaround point during our recce. That&amp;rsquo;s something to keep in mind if you&amp;rsquo;re racing it next year! On the other hand, the road surface was fantastic on pretty much all the route, and even the &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; bits were better than most our roads in the UK and it was definitely going to be a fast ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, we completely missed the &amp;ldquo;compulsory&amp;rdquo; race briefing while getting in another little bike/run/swim, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t really know how the run course would pan out. But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a real problem since the aid stations were well indicated on the race pack. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t know which way around the run would go, but there weren&amp;rsquo;t many options anyway and for sure there would be some snappy little climbs in town&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Racking and security was impressive, and for the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had both an electronic wristband and bike number, and a photo taken with the bike! The only thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like in transition was the T2 bags being all grouped together, and generally were a big pile up of bags without clear stickers on hooks/railings to get there quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was going to be wet overnight, and we got given a yellow sponsored cover so our babies would be somewhat dry for the race&amp;hellip; (ahem!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-09-14-ironman-70-3-zell-am-see-2013-the-wet-one/IMG_3016.png&quot; title=&quot;All tucked in!&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[6275]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-09-14-ironman-70-3-zell-am-see-2013-the-wet-one/IMG_3016_r300.png&quot; alt=&quot;All tucked in!&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;All tucked in!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the evening, after a normal dinner and even a small beer (!!) we went through our usual race routine, laying kit out and rehearsing transitions. I&amp;rsquo;ve also taken my usual time to do a bit of visualising. I wanted to have good transitions this time, or at least try! Nicely enough, too, there would be no need to set the alarm for a wake up at crazy-o'clock, since the start was scheduled for 10am!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday after a good night sleep we therefore had time to have a nice breakfast, take our time and walk to transition a km or so away, with ample time before the start. Some seem to be only arriving 1h before the start&amp;hellip; No idea how they made it in, but they must have been pretty stressed out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start of the swim was not a small funnel where everyone piles into. Well, not to get to the water at least. Because the queue to get to the start area was gigantic, and no one seemed to understand which coloured hat was supposed to go when. That was probably because of plenty of overstressed people, but it was very clearly indicated and announced on the speakers. Anyway, the actual swim start is a &amp;ldquo;deep&amp;rdquo; water start (you can still touch the bottom at the start), in waves, and along the walls of a local swim centre. We must have been at most 4 or 5 deep, and on a very wide line, so that was a nice change from the &lt;a href=&quot;/ironman-lanzarote-2013-race-report/&quot; title=&quot;Ironman Lanzarote 2013 – race report&quot;&gt;Lanzarote start&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I started the swim right at the front and on the right hand side. I needed to put myself in there if I wanted to home-in on a PB, and a swim I&amp;rsquo;d be happy of. That way I thought I&amp;rsquo;d be well positioned to get to the first buoy in more or less clear water, if people behind me would not swim me over, of course! But they didn&amp;rsquo;t, and with the exception of one feet-tapping idiot (who knew he was annoying me pretty quickly after I put my feet in his face) I had a very uneventful swim all the way around. I was probably a little bit further from the buoys than I wanted, but I played it a little on the safe side judging the melee of swimmers that was battling it out on my left.
I think I got pushed to the side by a strong current in the last 300m or so, as I can&amp;rsquo;t remember swimming the wrong way at all (I&amp;rsquo;m getting better at this! yay!), but still having to keep making adjustments towards the exit. That exit isn&amp;rsquo;t an easy one to sight for, though. From as far as the second buoy, it was very hard to distinguish the little &amp;ldquo;return&amp;rdquo; buoys, and I would have liked to see a much bigger buoy or inflatable arch for the swim finish. Even the buildings behind weren&amp;rsquo;t easy to spot in the grey clouded skies. So overall I am not *too* displeased with the time (32'26&quot; is a race swim PB for me after all) but I really hoped that I&amp;rsquo;d gotten closer to 30min given the conditions and the progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made this year in the pool. That&amp;rsquo;s for another time it seems!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T1 was yet another disaster time-wise. I had planned it well, but a combination of a long walk around and trying to put on my arm warms on wet skin didn&amp;rsquo;t help. I need to find another solution for wet days! I seem to have read that Steven Lord talks about some base layer under his wet suit from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevenlord.me.uk/STL/Blog/files/2013-09-09-IronmanWalesRaceAnalysis.php&quot; title=&quot;Ironman Wales Race Analysis by Steven Lord&quot;&gt;his Ironman Wales Analysis&lt;/a&gt;, I need to get some tips!! I then got stuck in a traffic jam of bikes exiting T1, further reducing my speed through it. I can always run fast with my bike, so that was a bummer. The transition area itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t badly laid out, but the exit/return funnel was a twisty 2 bikes wide lane with no room to overtake or do anything fast. So it was a bit of a patience game and I had to go with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bike started ok, it was drizzling, but not too much, and after wading through the initial residential streets, some slow-to-start athletes, and finally managing to get my feet into my shoes, I could initially put the power down quite well and was happy for a little bit of time. That was until the heavens opened and it started pouring and pouring and pouring. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been so wet other than swimming or taking a shower! I&amp;rsquo;ve definitely never been that wet on a bike! As I got colder and colder, I slowly lost power and couldn&amp;rsquo;t push as hard as I should have been. I tried to take on gels and bars, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t work too well. Shivering and having to hang on to the bike on very, very wet roads definitely played a big role in *not* reaching the numbers there.
Even in the heavy rain, the first lap seemed at the time to have gone ok. That&amp;rsquo;s possibly because of some adrenaline and some &amp;ldquo;targets&amp;rdquo; to catch. The second one, however, was hard going. Even if it was a little bit drier as the rain eased a bit (if you consider that dry). I strangely found myself alone with almost no one visible either in front or behind me for most of the last 40Km. That made it a well hard solo TT effort all the way to the line.
I believe plenty of riders on the day didn&amp;rsquo;t have the nuts to push on the wet roads or were simply too cold to do so. I&amp;rsquo;m confident in the rubber on my wheels and my handling skills, but it was indeed borderline at times. Not so much because of the roads condition, but mostly because of riders coming the other way or swerving across the road to find dry patches and avoid the unknown of puddles. Pothole underneath or not? No need to end up with a mechanical!
There was one thing that was absolutely fantastic though, something I really miss from short course racing: closed roads. That race was 90Km in two loops of completely traffic free roads! Pouring rain, but only other riders to contend with. Great stuff!!
I passed Ellen just before I finished the bike leg, and that gave me a massive boost. Seeing her doing what she&amp;rsquo;s be trying to train for all this time was great! If you want to know someone with some serious determination, get to know her, and be prepared to be blown to bits when you know how she has to prepare and how much she trains!
I was also relieved to arrive to T2, and not displeased with my bike time given the conditions. But with the training I&amp;rsquo;ve done, I should have been able to push a lot more on the bike! Looking at the data, I managed to get my target average power of 220W average ONLY on the very first 20min of the race. It went down from there to just under 200W at the end. Can do better! Still, 2h21'33&quot;! Bike PB absolutely blown to bits, and under the rain!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T2 itself was *almost* uneventful. But in a stroke of bad luck, the BOA system on my left shoe got stuck and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remove my foot from it before dismounting. This slowed me down a lot for the last 2Km of the bike as I tried to take my foot out unsuccessfully, and was further compounded by not dismounting the usual flying way, running on cleats all the way to the changing tent, and having to battle that pesky cable in the T2 tent. All valuable time gone!! I discovered since that this cable system has a quick release that I have never used and didn&amp;rsquo;t know it existed. What a muppet! (that&amp;rsquo;s like &amp;ldquo;anything&amp;rdquo; for newbies lessons: know your stuff!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, it stopped raining (I think!), so the run was relatively warm and humid, but not too wet.
This time I tried to go out hard and keep that hard pace for as long as I could, taking on coke at every other aid station. The run course was a nice mix of gravel path and tarmac + some flat cobbles in town. Twisty too with quite a few switchbacks and some nasty little inclines in Zell Am See&amp;rsquo;s town centre, which were killing my legs every lap. But things were going all right and I was only battling my own usual demons telling me to stop and take a rest. No, not this time! I walked at 70.3 Lanza last year, I walked at the Swashbuckler, I walked at Lanza IM (although this was planned), so this time, I would dig as deep as I could and push myself! I managed to hang on to some heels that were going at a pace I was happy with for pretty much all the way too. Drawing energy from others certainly helped!
I had also decided not to use my fuel belt to run more freely and it worked running-form wise. But it meant I carried my gels in my hands, and I lost one early on. I had to hang-on to the second one until late but I think I left it too late as my legs became jelly with about 3Km to go and I started to wobble across the track. That was probably because of that poor bike nutrition (again, when will I learn!?), but fortunately it happened right before an aid station, on the last lap at the start of the home stretch. Incidentally, it happened also right after I gave &lt;a title=&quot;Kate Driskell - Race Report: 70.3 Zell Am See 2013 - I have never raced so hard&quot; href=&quot;http://www.totkat.org/2013/09/race-report-703-zell-am-see-2013-i-have.html&quot;&gt;Kate Driskell, Freespeed athlete&lt;/a&gt; a shout. Give a shout and bonk is probably not the best thing to do!
I gulped two cups of coke, my gel and some fruits, then resumed hard to get to the line and it was ok. Thinking about it now, I did indeed dig a lot deeper than ever before, but would I have been able to resume so quickly if it was a real bonk? I&amp;rsquo;m not too sure, and that&amp;rsquo;s something I still need to make progress on.
With around 500m to go, I sighted one last &amp;ldquo;3 arm-bands&amp;rdquo; runner ahead of me and I went for it. I had no idea about his number, his age group or how he was running at the time, but he was the perfect target to finish hard. I passed him with about 150m to go, which possibly helped me get under the 4h40 bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for it, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see the cheers, and didn&amp;rsquo;t high five anyone. I was in a &amp;ldquo;you won&amp;rsquo;t get my slot&amp;rdquo; mode and raced to the line as if he was hunting me down in the finish chute. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t so that was not necessary, and completely useless slots-wise as we were far down the numbers, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that. I knew the time wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad, and a scalp is a scalp! Also, that&amp;rsquo;s great practice would the situation arise for real at the top end of a race some day! I can still find something at the end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve push myself that hard before on the run, so except for the nutrition mishap which started on the bike, I&amp;rsquo;m happy with it as I managed to get in that dark place and almost get through it.
And yet again, in this race that threw so much at everyone on the day, I managed a race best for a half marathon. I haven&amp;rsquo;t run that fast over this distance other than in a straight run race, and this one wasn&amp;rsquo;t all flat either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie, it was a hard day out there, but for once I&amp;rsquo;m happy with my performance. I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get into this zone of knowing how hard I can go. I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not there yet, but racing makes perfect to get to know where the &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; zone is.
Don&amp;rsquo;t ask me why, but I secretly hoped for top 25. That&amp;rsquo;s idiotic since with last year&amp;rsquo;s results, that would have required to finish in no more than 4h30m! But with a massive PB of more than 15min (previous was 4h55 in California, in the rain too), on a dirty fast course that wasn&amp;rsquo;t really suited for me, I can only be pleased! With that time last year I&amp;rsquo;d have been&amp;hellip; 57th!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But looking at my transitions times, which altogether for me nearly account for 14min of my race, I think they&amp;rsquo;re absolute rubbish. Not that I have a cup of coffee and a natter, but this time in T1 putting on arm warmers and socks was in a way necessary given the weather and my lack of fat (!), but I need to practice and find other solutions. In T2, my shoes got jammed. How is that possible? I&amp;rsquo;m your worst nightmare for taking care of any kit, and it&amp;rsquo;s MY shoes that get jammed&amp;hellip; I can only slap my own wrist though: I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know I could quickly release the cable on these shoes. Anyway, needless to say that I have a lot of work to do on transitions! With 5 to 7min less spent in the tents (which would give me around the same cumulative transition time as many of the guys ahead of me), I&amp;rsquo;d have possibly grabbed P12. Only with faster transitions!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the race, I refuelled aplenty chatting to other guys around who were still pretty cold and all wrapped in thermal foil, and the nice soup and plenty of local pizzas helped getting back on our feet. After a nice warm shower (I&amp;rsquo;m glad I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too far down the ranking, showers weren&amp;rsquo;t too full of crap yet!) I headed out on the run course to see were Ellen was, and it was great to push her around.
She was visibly hurting, and I&amp;rsquo;m guessing that&amp;rsquo;s a lot because of the weather, but she was still going well and it was fantastic to see her cross the line after last year&amp;rsquo;s disappointment in Lanzarote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shoes cables are now replaced, I got myself some new shoes too (without any complex system to break!), and I&amp;rsquo;m ready for the next one. Bring on Lanzarote 70.3 (again)!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The Swashbuckler 2013 - Finally incident-free!</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;2 weeks after &lt;a href=&quot;/ironman-lanzarote-2013-race-report/&quot; title=&quot;Ironman Lanzarote 2013 – race report&quot;&gt;IM Lanzarote&lt;/a&gt; this race was a bit early to have recovered well, or regain proper focus, but I had entered it well before Lanza, and I absolutely had to do it to finally get over my &lt;a href=&quot;/the-2011-swashbuckler-or-how-to-spend-5h-racing/&quot; title=&quot;The 2011 Swashbuckler – Or how to spend 5h racing&quot;&gt;unfinished&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/the-swashbuckler-2012-the-forest-wins-again/&quot; title=&quot;The Swashbuckler 2012 – The forest wins again&quot;&gt;business&lt;/a&gt; in the New Forest.
So it was a bit like a tourist that I went there, only initially wanting see how I would race being a bit tired, and also to give &lt;a title=&quot;Matthew Savory on Twitter&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/matt_savory&quot;&gt;Matthew&lt;/a&gt; from D3 Triathlon a good kick in the backside and motivate him to go faster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The difference in focus between this race and any other middle distance I&amp;rsquo;ve done is quite interesting. The Swashbuckler is so friendly and set in such a nice place that for the three years I&amp;rsquo;ve been there, I&amp;rsquo;ve been super chilled-out! Proof, my usual companion even wanted to enjoy the ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-06-06-the-swashbuckler-2013-finally-incident-free/IMG_2811.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Passenger&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[6233]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2013-06-06-the-swashbuckler-2013-finally-incident-free/IMG_2811_r300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Passenger&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Passenger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The race prep routine is always the same now, but the fact that this one is on home soil and only a couple of hours drive away probably helps too. Less hassle to get there, and back home the night of the race!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only Matt did the trip as well this year with his girlfriend, so it was a fairly small club committee!
That was totally unlike Thame Turbo who had their &amp;ldquo;club middle distance championship&amp;rdquo; at that race and were everywhere on the course and in the results!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, possibly because of the calendar change (it was 2 weeks later than usual) and to keep with the tide, the race start was at 6:15. Air temperature in the morning was 6C and heating up nicely, which was a nice change from the chilly 3C going onto 5C last year! Also, nice surprise: it was dry! No rain at racking time, no mud field to wade through in transition, and no frozen grass to get to the water! That water was a balmy 15C (apparently!), which this year is absolutely fantastic given the cold spell the whole of Europe is enduring, leading to plenty of swim cancellations everywhere. So these were great conditions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny enough, talking about cold conditions, the Marshall that was where I stopped last year on the bike course was now doing the race (to &amp;ldquo;find out what it&amp;rsquo;s all about&amp;rdquo;!) and recognised me in the pre-swim rubber clad crowd!! I hope he had a good time, it was surely a much better start to the day than the previous years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entering the water from the back of the field, I crossed over to the other side of the bunch to be on the outside of the front pack. That would give me clear water at least to the first buoy if I could stay there.
The mass start wasn&amp;rsquo;t as bad as I experienced it in the past, and the plan worked alright until I ended up face to face with that pesky harbour master in his dinghy! I&amp;rsquo;m sure I was on a perfect line towards the first buoy, so it&amp;rsquo;s not clear why he was there (it looked like he was indeed pushing back swimmers towards the moored boats), but it was a close call to avoid him and it meant I unfortunately had to get back in the pack. This slowed me down considerably as I didn&amp;rsquo;t have clear water anymore. The glare on the water from the rising sun was making it almost impossible to navigate, even with tinted goggles, so when back in the pack, I could only follow swimmers in front.
Given the amount of shouting around the first buoy, it&amp;rsquo;s also clear that there has been many a swimmer getting in the path of the fast guys at the front, who had already rounded that buoy and were coming back towards the harbour.
I never really managed to settle in a good rhythm. The return leg is narrow, between moored boats, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave any space for error or direction changes. When you&amp;rsquo;re mid pack, you unfortunately have to accept that fate, so I went on a well as I could, but I lost focus and didn&amp;rsquo;t have a great swim, exiting the water in a bit more than 35min. I was stil ahead of Matthew though, who passed me in T1 while I was getting dressed…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long T1 saw me take absolutely no chances on the cold this year, given that I froze on the bike leg two years in a row, with a forced stop last year as the shivering was getting dangerous to ride. This time I chose to put on my tri top only in T1 so it would be dry, arm warmers, a short sleeve jersey, short gloves AND long ones on top. I will really have to work on speedier T1s from now on though! That&amp;rsquo;s getting shameful, but I wanted a cold-free race, and it turns out it was the right amount of gear for me on that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bike was a lot better than the last 2 years. No puncture, not cold, and able to put some power down after a little while. Actually I managed to produce quite a fair bit of power compared to my usual outputs!
As I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any special goals for this race other than get over the disappointments of the last two years, I decided there and then to put myself to the test (like one stupidly does on race day, just like this, for no apparent reason!) and push hard to see how this would play on my run! I was stunned to be able to maintain 220W for the first hour an kept it all there until the end with a race best average of 216W, all bang on 80% heart rate! My CP20 being so far 258W, this average for more than 2h rings well! I really thought I&amp;rsquo;d pay for that on the run, but that was kind of the goal! The only issue I had on the bike with outputting high power was nutrition. I could feel that my stomach wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready to receive much, and that was confirmed in T2 as I had drank barely more than half my gels bottle and not even eaten half the bars in my box. I had however done a 2h15 for 50 miles, just two weeks after Lanzarote, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T2 was uneventful and slowish again, but not as slow as last year when I had forgotten to remove my gloves and had to stop to get rid of them. I had after all more layers to remove than many others athletes, and it still takes a few seconds to remove all that stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I surprisingly shot out on the run course like a man possessed at 4'10&quot;/km and had to slap my wrist again and slow down! But other than feeling a bit tight overall, I was feeling good! Clocking on average high 4'20&quot;s for the first lap, I stopped at a couple of aid stations on the second one to get some water in which slowed down my average overall, but I was running well.
Things got a bit tougher at the end of the first lap, but I managed to pick up the pace again after that to pull out a 1h40' for 14miles! Race best in everything (maybe except the swim, and certainly not transition!) but with 4h43 overall, P39 and P20 in my AG, that was a good result with the &amp;lsquo;tired tourist&amp;rsquo; prep I had!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt came in not long afterwards but didn&amp;rsquo;t have the race he wanted. I guess he also may have held back a little (consciously or not), as he is doing ironman UK 70.3 in two weeks, which has a very different course profile!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever felt so drained after a race though, not even the ones in which I bonked last year, and not even after my IMs. It&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing though, as it means this time I did push well enough to be on the limit towards the end, which is all good learnings moving forward!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can finally tick the Swashbuckler box off my list, as this year I had no issue during the race! I may be back, possibly for another race with the club. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.racenewforest.co.uk/&quot; title=&quot;Race New Forest&quot;&gt;The New Forest&lt;/a&gt; is a brilliant place to race, and Richard and Joanne are still the most friendly and welcoming organisers I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in the racing world! Thanks to them for putting on such nice events and to their marshalls for being ever enthusiastic and smiling!&lt;/p&gt;
